/**
 * sovereigntyLightingContract.walker.test.js — THE INSTRUMENT THAT REPLACES THE PHANTOM.
 *
 * Five doc homes stated `sovereigntyTradeEnabled`'s green condition as "SP-B + SP-B2 +
 * ES-4 landed" and pointed at a WR-9 certification lighting-order row as if it were an
 * artifact. It never was — re-measured across src/, tests/ and docs/ at the fold head
 * `32cc17f7` and again at this landing. This file, with `SOVEREIGNTY_LIGHTING_EVIDENCE`
 * in src/domain/certification/warConvergenceContract.js, is the artifact: the contract
 * declares the three wave evidences and their addresses, and this walker MEASURES whether
 * each has arrived.
 *
 * ── WHY IT MUST STAY GREEN TODAY, AND WHAT THAT COSTS IT ────────────────────────
 * ES-4 is unbuilt, so the condition reads `UNSATISFIED_TRACKED`. A walker that failed on
 * that would red the base suite for the crime of the build order being the build order,
 * and the first thing anyone would do is delete it. So the assertions are chosen so that
 * BOTH build states pass:
 *
 *   • RATCHET — SP-B's and SP-B2's evidence must be PRESENT. Those waves have landed;
 *     if either regresses this reds, and that is a correct red.
 *   • BICONDITIONAL — the condition reads SATISFIED if and only if ES-4's marker is
 *     found. Green in both worlds, and it proves the state is driven by the measurement
 *     rather than by a constant.
 *   • MUTANTS — the evaluator is driven with injected presence maps: all-three ⇒
 *     SATISFIED (the flip, proven without waiting for ES-4), and each row absent in turn
 *     ⇒ UNSATISFIED_TRACKED naming exactly that wave (the discrimination).
 *   • NEGATIVE CONTROL — a fabricated marker finds nothing, so "found" is a real read
 *     and not a substring that always hits.
 *
 * ── WHAT THIS FILE DELIBERATELY IS NOT ──────────────────────────────────────────
 * It is not a second gate scanner. `ENGINE_GATED_VIRTUAL_RULE_KEYS` is the estate's own
 * register of virtual keys that have a real gate — the CQ5 one-commit law puts a key
 * there in the SAME commit as its first gate read — so joining against it is an exact
 * mechanical read of build state that costs no new machinery. The trade sibling's R6
 * repair is the precedent, and its lesson is the reason no row here declares its own
 * build state: a table that asserts what it is supposed to be measuring can only ever
 * agree with itself.
