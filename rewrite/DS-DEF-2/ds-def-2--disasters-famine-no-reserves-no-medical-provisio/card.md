THE CARD (mechanical sections) — block DS-DEF-2 · pool `Disasters & Famine: NO reserves, NO medical provision` · dir ds-def-2-disasters-famine-no-reserves-no-medical-provision

(1) THE KEY AND ITS PREIMAGE
  key function: DISASTER_ROW_POOL (rung table) · site defense.threatAssessment
  census predicate: disasterRowSituation(granary, hospital, church) (via DISASTER_ROW_POOL in defenseStateProse.js) === no reserves, no medical provision
  read granary        -> economicState.compound.inst.hasGranary   [SNAPSHOT] writers 0   (resolved through disasterRowPoolKey's call site in the entry point)
  read hospital       -> economicState.compound.inst.hasHospital  [SNAPSHOT] writers 0   (resolved through disasterRowPoolKey's call site in the entry point)
  read church         -> economicState.compound.inst.hasChurch    [SNAPSHOT] writers 0   (resolved through disasterRowPoolKey's call site in the entry point)
  the key FIXES: granary=false · hospital=false · leaves OPEN: church   (disasterRowPoolKey, 2 combination(s))
  preimage on the 768-town rate grid: 353 towns (4596 bp) — thorp 128/128 · hamlet 128/128 · village 97/128
  silent tiers: town, city, metropolis

(2) THE REQUIRED ROWS (institutionalCatalog required: true) at every preimage tier — bodies a face may not deny or infer away
  thorp (5): Burial ground [Religious] · Dwellings (4-16) [Infrastructure] · Water source [Infrastructure] · Access to external mill [Economy] · Subsistence farming [Economy]
  hamlet (7): Access to parish church [Religious] · Burial ground [Religious] · Dwellings (17-80) [Infrastructure] · Water source [Infrastructure] · Access to external mill [Economy] · Subsistence farming [Economy] · Common grazing land [Economy]
  village (7): Multiple water sources [Infrastructure] · Dwellings (80-180) [Infrastructure] · Farmland [Economy] · Mill [Crafts] · Parish church [Religious] · Priest (resident) [Religious] · Graveyard [Religious]

(2b) WHAT A FACE MAY NOT DENY OF THE REQUIRED ROWS — the services the engine's own menu turns on at p ≥ 0.8, and the derivation that files the row
  Access to external mill (required at thorp, hamlet) — a face may not deny: (no service menu at or above the bar) · filed under no closed roster
  Access to parish church (required at hamlet) — a face may not deny: Sunday mass (p 1) · Baptism (p 0.9) · Last rites (p 0.9) · Marriage ceremony (p 0.9) · filed under the `church` roster
  Burial ground (required at thorp, hamlet) — a face may not deny: Burial (p 1) · filed under no closed roster
  Common grazing land (required at hamlet) — a face may not deny: (no service menu at or above the bar) · filed under no closed roster
  Dwellings (17-80) (required at hamlet) — a face may not deny: (no service menu at or above the bar) · filed under no closed roster
  Dwellings (4-16) (required at thorp) — a face may not deny: (no service menu at or above the bar) · filed under no closed roster
  Dwellings (80-180) (required at village) — a face may not deny: (no service menu at or above the bar) · filed under no closed roster
  Farmland (required at village) — a face may not deny: (no service menu at or above the bar) · filed under no closed roster
  Graveyard (required at village) — a face may not deny: Burial (p 1) · filed under no closed roster
  Mill (required at village) — a face may not deny: Grain milling (p 1) · filed under no closed roster
  Multiple water sources (required at village) — a face may not deny: (no service menu at or above the bar) · filed under no closed roster
  Parish church (required at village) — a face may not deny: Life ceremonies (p 1) · Religious services (p 1) · filed under the `church` roster
  Priest (resident) (required at village) — a face may not deny: Life ceremonies (p 1) · Religious services (p 1) · filed under the `church` roster
  Subsistence farming (required at thorp, hamlet) — a face may not deny: (no service menu at or above the bar) · filed under no closed roster
  Water source (required at thorp, hamlet) — a face may not deny: (no service menu at or above the bar) · filed under no closed roster
  ⛔ A SERVICE AT OR ABOVE THE BAR IS A THING THE TOWN'S OWN MODEL SAYS THIS BODY DOES: denying it is floor 1, whatever the face is otherwise about. A row filed under `standing` is UNDER ARMS in the engine's reading even where the key fixes no garrison and no militia.

(2b′) THE OBSERVER'S AND THE PUBLIC'S LIST: what neither may claim to have seen
  Access to external mill (required at thorp, hamlet) — NOT SEEN is a claim about: (no service menu at or above the bar)
  Access to parish church (required at hamlet) — NOT SEEN is a claim about: Sunday mass · Baptism · Last rites · Marriage ceremony
  Burial ground (required at thorp, hamlet) — NOT SEEN is a claim about: Burial
  Common grazing land (required at hamlet) — NOT SEEN is a claim about: (no service menu at or above the bar)
  Dwellings (17-80) (required at hamlet) — NOT SEEN is a claim about: (no service menu at or above the bar)
  Dwellings (4-16) (required at thorp) — NOT SEEN is a claim about: (no service menu at or above the bar)
  Dwellings (80-180) (required at village) — NOT SEEN is a claim about: (no service menu at or above the bar)
  Farmland (required at village) — NOT SEEN is a claim about: (no service menu at or above the bar)
  Graveyard (required at village) — NOT SEEN is a claim about: Burial
  Mill (required at village) — NOT SEEN is a claim about: Grain milling
  Multiple water sources (required at village) — NOT SEEN is a claim about: (no service menu at or above the bar)
  Parish church (required at village) — NOT SEEN is a claim about: Life ceremonies · Religious services
  Priest (resident) (required at village) — NOT SEEN is a claim about: Life ceremonies · Religious services
  Subsistence farming (required at thorp, hamlet) — NOT SEEN is a claim about: (no service menu at or above the bar)
  Water source (required at thorp, hamlet) — NOT SEEN is a claim about: (no service menu at or above the bar)
  ⛔ AN OBSERVATION AND A PUBLIC FACE ARE FACTS THEIR SPEAKER CLAIMS (rulings 27 (a), 28 (a)), so neither may INFER INTO A SILENCE a required row denies. On a preimage carrying a `Town watch`, "no member of the watch has walked the wall" is floor 1 in a witness's coat; "no soldier has been seen on the wall" is true on every town that draws a key fixing no garrison and no militia. The PUBLIC's second half — what everyone MAKES of what it saw — is a perception and may be mistaken; the seeing may not.
  ⛔ AND THE FAIR COPY DOES NOT CITE ITSELF (ADDENDUM 18 ruling 40, the owner's): an observation is a BARE PASSIVE with no observer named — never "in the survey's time here", "on the nights the survey kept", "it is observed that", "this office".

(2c) COVERT FIELDS AND THEIR SYMPTOMS ON THIS BLOCK (ADDENDUM 18 ruling 26) — the INVERTED test the refuter judges a `compromised` face under
    hall ← powerStructure.criminalCaptureState at `corrupted` or `capture`
        SYMPTOM: THE PURSE AND THE ACCOUNTS — what the hall says the town's money does, and who decides it. DS-DEF-4 says the fact outright ("the hall's decisions are not the hall's"), so a hall face on a purse pool may reassure that the accounts are in order and may deny NOTHING ELSE.
        marks the pools: Invasion & War: walls with NO force · Economic Survival: STRONG · Economic Survival: ADEQUATE · Economic Survival: WEAK
        this pool is NOT one of them — here the source draws as any source
    watch ← a bloc carrying `covert: true` (settlementPolitics)
        SYMPTOM: THE WATCH'S OWN KEEPING — the circuit, the wage, who is on the walk after dark. A watch face on an internal-security pool may say the patrol is kept as it has always been kept, and may deny nothing about the court, the purse or the walls.
        marks the pools: Internal Security: full legal chain (court AND prison) · Internal Security: detention without process · Internal Security: no legal infrastructure
        this pool is NOT one of them — here the source draws as any source
    court ← a bloc carrying `covert: true` (settlementPolitics)
        SYMPTOM: WHAT REACHES THE LAW AND WHAT IT DOES WITH IT — a court face on a legal-chain pool may hold that matters are heard as they should be, and may deny nothing else.
        marks the pools: Internal Security: full legal chain (court AND prison) · Internal Security: court without detention
        this pool is NOT one of them — here the source draws as any source
  ⛔ THE INVERTED TEST. A face tagged `compromised` is the ONE place the reassurance tell is the point (ruling 26 (a)), and FLOOR 1 IS RE-POINTED FOR IT ALONE (26 (b)): it may deny the VISIBLE SYMPTOM of the very field it is compromised by, in the direction of CONCEALMENT ONLY. It never denies an unrelated field, never a required row, and never names the covert fact. The archiver reports it as flatly as any account: no wink.
  ⛔ THE CONCEALMENT MUST NOT IDENTIFY (26 (f)): offer more than one shape — dismiss · reassure · minimise · change the subject · blame the source of the talk · say nothing beyond the form. An HONEST source may also reassure truthfully on a small share of honest towns, so a reassurance on the page is a question and never an answer.
  ⛔ AND THE SOURCE IS SILENT SOME OF THE TIME (26 (h)): where a compromised source is present on a marked pool, a roll seeded on the world seed, the pool key, the settlement and the CURRENT YEAR decides whether it speaks (0.7) or says nothing. Its silence is a behaviour, and the roll decides WHO SPEAKS and never WHAT IS TRUE.
  ⛔ THE TAG IS REFUSED on any source no covert field can compromise; the table is CLOSED: hall · watch · court.

  PLACEMENTS A FACE MAY NOT ASSERT — where a body STANDS, stated by the data at some preimage tiers and not others, or stated with a hedge
    Burial ground: "at the edge" — stated only at hamlet — silent at thorp, village   [the catalog row]
        the data says: "A walled plot at the edge of the settlement, gated against livestock and kept by the households in turn."
  ⛔ A FACE DRAWS ON EVERY TOWN OF THE PREIMAGE, so a placement the data states only at the city is an INVENTION on the thorp (floor 2), and a hedged one is a tendency rather than this town's fact.

(2d) THE KEY'S SIBLING RUNGS — what this pool's key would have been had ONE of the fields it fixes been otherwise
    granary = false HERE
        granary = true -> `Disasters & Famine: granary AND parish care only`
    hospital = false HERE
        hospital = true -> `Disasters & Famine: NO reserves, hospital present`
  ⛔ A FACE THAT READS AS A NEIGHBOURING RUNG IS A FLOOR-1 FINDING (ADDENDUM 18 ruling 35). These pools have their OWN faces and their own towns: a sentence here that would sit as comfortably on one of them is either saying nothing this key fixes, or is saying something this key fixes is FALSE. The refuter names the rung.

================================================================================

(7) THE SPEAKERS

⛔ READ THIS BEFORE THE ROSTER. **The preimage is entirely BELOW TOWN** — thorp 128/128,
hamlet 128/128, village 97/128, and the instrument's own line reads `silent tiers: town, city,
metropolis`. The brief's standing roster seats **the hall, the tavern, the guilds and the
register at town and above**. This pool never draws a town. Therefore, on this card:

  • **THE HALL IS NOT A SPEAKER AND NOT A PLACE.** F1-20: at thorp and hamlet the governing
    institution is `Head-of-household consensus` / `Informal elder consensus` — a consensus,
    not a room. No `Town hall` row exists at any preimage tier. V-29 names "the hall at a
    hamlet" as a live floor-1 finding. No hall, no chamber, no clerk of the hall, no accounts.
  • **THE TAVERN IS NOT UNIVERSAL.** No drinking row at thorp at all; `Alehouse` 0.55 at
    hamlet; `Ale house` 0.80 at village. "At the tavern they say" is a conditional source here,
    not the safe one the brief makes it at town.
  • **THE GUILDS DO NOT EXIST.** No guild row at thorp, hamlet or village in the catalogue.
  • **THE WATCH, THE MUSTER AND WHOEVER HOLDS THE WAY THROUGH DO NOT EXIST.** Section (5):
    watch · garrison · militia · mercenary · charter · walls · gates are ALL **OPEN** — the key
    fixes none and no required row seats any. They are unavailable as speakers and as bodies.
  • **THE CROWN'S ASSESSOR IS NOT A SPEAKER** anywhere (no typed producer; the brief).

So the safe roster on this pool is small, and it is made of people and ground, not of offices.

--- UNIVERSAL (a `required: true` row on every preimage tier seats them) ---

  1. THE HOUSEHOLDS WHO FARM — `Dwellings (4-16)/(17-80)/(80-180)` + `Subsistence farming`
     (thorp, hamlet) / `Farmland` (village), all `required: true`.
     INTEREST: they carry the whole of the key. The stores that are not kept are theirs to not
     keep, and a failed harvest lands on them the same season. Their stake is their own year.
     ⚠ `Subsistence farming` = "Each household farms ~12-16 acres for survival"; `Farmland` =
     "Open-field agriculture with crop rotation" — the FORM of the farming differs by tier, so
     write the households, never the field system.

  2. THOSE WHO BURY THE DEAD — `Burial ground` (thorp, hamlet) / `Graveyard` (village),
     `required: true`, service `Burial` p 1.0 on all three.
     INTEREST: the only body in this pool whose work rises when the key bites. They bury and
     **they keep no book**: the register-bearing burial rows are `Parish burial grounds` and
     `Cemetery network` (service `Register of the dead` / `Central register`), and NEITHER is
     seated at any preimage tier. See the F1-24 row in (8).

  3. WHOEVER GRINDS THE GRAIN — `Access to external mill` (thorp, hamlet, `required: true`,
     "Must travel to manor/village mill. Home grinding often illegal") / `Mill` (village,
     `required: true`, service `Grain milling` p 1.0).
     INTEREST: the grain passes through one pair of hands before anybody eats it, and on a
     no-reserves town that is the only choke point the record actually seats. The village row
     hands you the stake in its own words: the miller is the wealthiest and most resented
     figure in the village.
     ⚠ **SPLIT IN PLACE, NOT IN SUBSTANCE.** Below village the mill is OUTSIDE the settlement
     and the grain travels to it. A face may say the grain goes out to be ground; a face may
     NOT stand a mill in the settlement (F1-15). And see (8) on the singular "the miller".

  4. THOSE WHO DRAW THE WATER — `Water source` (thorp, hamlet) / `Multiple water sources`
     (village), `required: true`. No service menu at or above the bar.
     INTEREST: thin as a speaker, thick as ground. It is where the town gathers without being
     convened, and on a plague-onset town it is the one place everyone must still go.

  5. THE STRANGER — seated by the brief on every town, needing no row.
     INTEREST: arrives, looks for the thing a place this size is expected to have, and is
     directed to nothing. What the town has stopped noticing is visible to them on the first
     day. ⚠ their eye is bounded by (2b′): they may report only what could be SEEN.

  6. THE ELDERS (plural only) — ⚠ **THE MARKER'S OWN CALL, RECORDED FOR VETO.** The brief
     seats "the elders below town" as a safe source and F1-22 resolves the `elders` kind on
     `Household elder · Village elder · Village headman · Town council`. Three of those sit in
     this preimage at high base chance (`Household elder` 0.90 thorp, `Village headman` 0.90
     hamlet, `Village elder` 0.95 village) — but **none is `required: true`**, and ADDENDUM 18
     ruling 16 is strict: a power only where an institution row backs it. I seat them as
     universal on the brief's word, and I direct the writers to phrase the attribution so it
     survives a strict reading — "the older households", "those here who have seen a bad year"
     — rather than "the elders' council", which asserts a body no required row carries.
     INTEREST: memory without a record. They are the only source on this pool who can say what
     is usually done, and their authority is that nobody has written anything down.

--- CONDITIONAL (the field that seats each, and where it does not) ---

  THE PARISH — `Access to parish church` (hamlet, required) · `Parish church` + `Priest
    (resident)` (village, required) · at THORP only `Access to parish church` 0.78 or
    `Wayside shrine` 0.30, so the parish is **absent on some thorps**.
    INTEREST: the care nobody is paid for. At village the priest is "often only literate
    person" — the nearest thing to a record this pool ever holds.
    ⛔ THREE DIFFERENT SHAPES, AND A FACE DRAWS ACROSS ALL THREE: at hamlet the church is
    2-5 km AWAY and there is no resident priest row; at village the church and the priest are
    here; at thorp there may be neither. So: no church BUILDING in the settlement (F1-11,
    V-29), no "the priest" (no resident-priest row below village, and `Parish Priest` is the
    hamlet's mandatory NPC), no parish register (see (8)).
  THE TAVERN — `Alehouse` 0.55 hamlet · `Ale house` 0.80 village · nothing at thorp.
    INTEREST: the account of who is short and who is not, told where nobody is on the record.
  THE REEVE OR STEWARD — `Lord's reeve` 0.30 thorp · `Lord's steward` 0.55 hamlet / 0.30
    village · `Village reeve` 0.92 village.
    INTEREST: the outside claim on the harvest. The only source on this pool whose stake runs
    against the town's. ⚠ conditional, and the archaic word is licensed only where the
    sentence shows the reeve doing the thing (brief, PLAIN LANGUAGE).
  THE MARKET — `Periodic market` 0.12 hamlet · `Weekly market` 0.60 village. F1-10 binds.
  THOSE WHO TREAT THE SICK WITHOUT A HOSPITAL — `Midwife` 0.50 village ("The most-used
    medical service in any settlement") · `Apothecary` 0.45 village · `Traveling hedge wizard`
    0.20 hamlet. All conditional, none sets `hasHospital`. See (8) — this is the card's
    sharpest row.
  THE SHARED STORE — `Communal root cellar` 0.25 thorp: "A shared underground store for grain,
    roots, and preserved food. **Vital buffer against a bad harvest.**" It does not match
    `granar`, so it stands on a town this key calls NO reserves. See (8).
  THE TRADES — `Resident smith (part-time)` 0.40 / `Carpenter` 0.50 hamlet; `Blacksmith` 0.90,
    `Carpenter` 0.70, `Brewer` 0.45, `Cooper` 0.30 village. `Fishing community` 0.72 /
    `Woodcutter's camp` 0.55 / `Shepherd collective` 0.35 thorp.
  ⛔ `Thatcher` 0.60 village is a ROW, never a licence: F3-05 bars thatch on the five
    non-north-European culture profiles, and no defense pool reads the profile.

--- THE NAMED OFFICES A SPEAKER MUST NEVER BE (`npcGenerator.js:1511-1537`, F3-06) ---

  thorp:   **Elder** + a second role derived from the town's own facts
           (`npc/thorpSecondRole.js`: Fisherman · Woodcutter · Shepherd · **Miller**)
  hamlet:  **Elder** · **Parish Priest**
  village: **Mayor** · **Guard Captain**
  and by stress, on any tier: famine → **Healer**, **Guild Master** · plague_onset →
  **Healer**, **Parish Priest** · indebted → **Moneylender** · mass_migration → **Guild
  Master**, **Healer** · wartime / monster_pressure / under_siege → **Garrison Commander** et al.

  ⛔ SO, ON THIS POOL: never "the elder", never "the priest" or "the parish priest", never
  "the mayor", never "the guard captain", **never "the miller"** (the thorp's fallback second
  role), and — on the two stresses this pool's subject invites most — **never "the healer"**.
  Each is one generated person on the next tab with a personality, a disposition and a secret.
  The plural, the trade and the ground are all free: the older households · whoever grinds the
  grain · those who bury · a woman who knows which roots bring a fever down.

--- THE TWO NPC SEAMS THE WRITERS MUST KNOW ABOUT ---

  ⚠ **EVERY VILLAGE MINTS A GUARD CAPTAIN** while (5) leaves watch, garrison and militia all
  OPEN. A face reading "nobody here is charged with anyone's safety" is contradicted on the NPC
  tab of every village in the preimage. Write the absence as the ABSENCE OF A BODY, never as
  the absence of a person.
  ⚠ **A FAMINE OR PLAGUE-ONSET TOWN MINTS A HEALER** while this key says no medical provision.
  The two are not the same fact — the key denies the `Healer (divine, 1st level)` ROW, the NPC
  generator seats a person — but a face that says nobody here has any healing in them collides
  with that person on the same dossier.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

(8) WHAT WOULD BE FALSE

The key fixes two flags and nothing else, and both of them are narrower than their English:
`hasGranary` false denies only a row matching `granar` (`priorityHelpers.js:63`), and
`hasHospital` false denies only `hospital · monastery · healer · friary` (`:64`) — so what this
pool may assert is that the town keeps **no granary building** and holds **no hospital,
infirmary, monastery, friary or `Healer (divine, 1st level)` row**, and nothing whatever beyond
that. The single largest hazard on the card, and the one the SHIPPED corpus already walks into,
is reading "NO medical provision" as "nobody treats the sick": at VILLAGE the `required: true`
row `Priest (resident)` carries the service **`Healing` — `{ on: true, p: 0.7, "Divine healing
magic for the sick and injured." }`, the only `Healing` service in the whole service file** —
so on 97 of the 353 towns a required row heals with divine magic while this key holds, and
`hasChurch` is TRUE at hamlet and village alike (`Access to parish church` and `Parish church`
both fire it, `priorityHelpers.js:65`), which means the machine sentence printed two inches
away on 225 of the 353 towns reads "Parish clergy provide basic wound care: better than
nothing, worse than a hospital" (`threatAssessment.js:181`) and "Parish care. Basic wound and
disease management" (`defenseDisplay.js:239`); the shipped `[ledger]` face's "has nobody to
treat the sick" and its "a plague runs until it burns out" are therefore [F1] on every hamlet
and village of the preimage, since the sentence they echo ("No medical infrastructure. Plague
spreads until it burns out.") fires only where `hasChurch` is false — which here is **thorps
only** — and on top of that a village may carry a `Midwife` ("The most-used medical service in
any settlement") or an `Apothecary` who "knows which roots treat fever", neither of which
touches `hasHospital`. The same trap runs on the food side in the other direction: a thorp may
carry a `Communal root cellar`, "a shared underground store … **vital buffer against a bad
harvest**", which does not match `granar` and so stands on a town this key calls NO reserves
[F1-25, F1-30 — never assert the absence, write around it]; the engine itself still prints a
granary READING with no granary row, capacity falling through to 1.5/2.0 months
(`foodStockpile.js:190-193`, §1.4 W-07); "there is no food at all" is refused by name
(F1-76, and `stressorDynamics.js:469` "this famine is not a failure of harvest"); and where
`tradeRouteAccess === 'port'` the page beside the face reads "No reserves, but sea supply
continues while port is open" (`defenseDisplay.js:245`), so no face may close the town off
[F1-79, F1-103, F4-09]. Because the preimage is wholly below town, the four rosters bite
hardest as SILENCES a face must not fill: there is **no hall, chamber or clerk** [F1-20, V-29],
**no tavern at thorp**, **no guild anywhere**, and **no watch, garrison, militia, mercenary,
charter, walls or gates fixed by anything** [F1-01, F1-02, F1-03, F1-07, F1-08, V-23, V-27] —
and equally no face may DENY them, since they are OPEN and a custom or rolled row can seat any
of them [F1-25, F1-30]. There is likewise **no record this pool may cite**: the only
register-bearing burial rows are `Parish burial grounds` and `Cemetery network`, neither seated
here; `Parish church`'s own `Records` service is `on: false` at p 0.5; no treasury, no toll
book, no muster roll, no minutes and no accounts exist on any town of this preimage, so any
cited book is [F1-24 / §R-8] and "the books" as a generic is barred outright (brief, F1-24).
On place: the church at HAMLET is 2-5 km away, so no church building stands in the settlement
[F1-11, V-29]; the mill below village is external and "home grinding often illegal", so no mill
stands in a thorp or hamlet [F1-15]; and the `Burial ground`'s "at the edge" placement is
stated only at hamlet, so it may not be asserted across the pool (the instrument's own
placement row). On floor 2, this pool's subject is a magnet for every barred form: no count of
what is stored or of who is sick, in a digit or a word ("a handful of sacks", "most households"
are magnitudes) [F2-01]; no season, no month, no "until the spring", no "three months' food"
[F2-02]; no harvest that failed, no sickness that came, no healer who left [F2-04]; and **no
elapsed course over a LIVE field** — but note the licence the census hands you: `hasGranary`,
`hasHospital` and `hasChurch` all carry **zero pulse writers** and are FROZEN, and they are the
key's own reads, so the perfect and the durative ARE lawful over them ("nothing has ever been
put by here", "no one has been kept for treating the sick") while `institutions` at any bucket
grain (38 writers) and `name` (201) are LIVE and refuse it [ruling 11, §V.0 floor 2]. No rate
("every winter", "most nights") [F2-06]. On floor 3, the singular offices listed in (7) are
barred, thatch and the churchyard and the market green are barred on five of the eleven culture
profiles [F3-05], and nothing may be predicated of a deity — the followers act, the god does
not [F3-02]; a creed's people may keep a duty or neglect it, and that is the whole of what is
available. On floor 4: no permanence and no decay clock over any fabric [F4-01]; the disaster
gate is one purse with a floor of 0.55 and never reaches zero, so "nothing has ever been spent
on it" is refused while "short, late, thin" is licensed [F4-03, F4-04]; `plagued` is MONSTERS
and never disease [F4-05]; and no face may name a covert fact, though (2c) records that this
pool marks none, so the `compromised` tag is REFUSED here and every source draws honest. Two
seams close the paragraph, both of which make a true-sounding sentence false: a **Guard
Captain** is minted on every village while no force row is fixed, and a **Healer** is minted on
every famine and plague-onset town while this key denies the healer ROW — so the absence this
pool describes is an absence of BUILDINGS AND STORES, never of people, and the moment a face
says nobody here can do a thing, it is contradicted by a person on the next tab.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

(9) WHERE THE FLAVOUR IS

  WHAT IS IN USE. The grain leaves before anybody eats it — below village there is no mill
  here at all and home grinding is illegal, so every household's year goes out on a cart to
  someone else's stone and comes back lighter; at village the one mill holds the monopoly and
  the row itself says the miller is the most resented figure in the place. The burial ground is
  the only thing in this pool that is required, works, and gets busier when the key bites: it
  buries and it writes nothing down, and at a thorp the words over the grave are said by
  whoever knew the dead best, because no clergy lives near enough. The water source is where
  the whole town has to go whether or not anyone wants to be seen.

  WHAT IS IN DISPUTE. Whose year it is. The households farm for survival and the outside claim
  — a lord's reeve, a steward, a tithe to a church two to five kilometres off — arrives on the
  same harvest that is the only reserve anyone has. Whether the parish's care counts as care:
  at village a priest who is often the only literate person does sacraments, tithes and divine
  healing, and whether that is medicine or something else is exactly the kind of thing two
  sources will set down differently. Whether anything is stored at all: one town's shared root
  cellar is the next town's admission that there is nothing to put in it.

  WHAT THE ABSENCE LOOKS LIKE ON THE GROUND. Not emptiness — arrangement. Nobody built the
  building, so the function lives in people and in ordinary places: the sick are kept in the
  house they fell ill in; what is put by is put by under one family's floor and not the town's;
  a stranger asks where the stores are and is shown a field. The town does not experience this
  as a lack, which is the hook — it is how a place this size has always been arranged, and the
  question the dossier opens is what happens the first year that arrangement is asked for
  more than it can give.
