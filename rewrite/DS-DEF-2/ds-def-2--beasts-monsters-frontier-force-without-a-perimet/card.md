  preimage on the 768-town rate grid: 22 towns (286 bp) — hamlet 10/128 · village 10/128 · town 2/128
  silent tiers: thorp, city, metropolis

  ⛔ A SERVICE AT OR ABOVE THE BAR IS A THING THE TOWN'S OWN MODEL SAYS THIS BODY DOES: denying it is floor 1, whatever the face is otherwise about. A row filed under `standing` is UNDER ARMS in the engine's reading even where the key fixes no garrison and no militia.

  ⛔ AN OBSERVATION AND A PUBLIC FACE ARE FACTS THEIR SPEAKER CLAIMS (rulings 27 (a), 28 (a)), so neither may INFER INTO A SILENCE a required row denies. On a preimage carrying a `Town watch`, "no member of the watch has walked the wall" is floor 1 in a witness's coat; "no soldier has been seen on the wall" is true on every town that draws a key fixing no garrison and no militia. The PUBLIC's second half — what everyone MAKES of what it saw — is a perception and may be mistaken; the seeing may not.
  ⛔ AND THE FAIR COPY DOES NOT CITE ITSELF (ADDENDUM 18 ruling 40, the owner's): an observation is a BARE PASSIVE with no observer named — never "in the survey's time here", "on the nights the survey kept", "it is observed that", "this office".

(2c) COVERT FIELDS AND THEIR SYMPTOMS ON THIS BLOCK (ADDENDUM 18 ruling 26) — the INVERTED test the refuter judges a `compromised` face under
    hall ← powerStructure.criminalCaptureState at `corrupted` or `capture`
        SYMPTOM: THE PURSE AND THE ACCOUNTS — what the hall says the town's money does, and who decides it. DS-DEF-4 says the fact outright ("the hall's decisions are not the hall's"), so a hall face on a purse pool may reassure that the accounts are in order and may deny NOTHING ELSE.
        marks the pools: Invasion & War: walls with NO force · Economic Survival: STRONG · Economic Survival: ADEQUATE · Economic Survival: WEAK
        this pool is NOT one of them — here the source draws as any source
    watch ← a bloc carrying `covert: true` (settlementPolitics)
        SYMPTOM: THE WATCH'S OWN KEEPING — the circuit, the wage, who is on the walk after dark. A watch face on an internal-security pool may say the patrol is kept as it has always been kept, and may deny nothing about the court, the purse or the walls.
        marks the pools: Internal Security: full legal chain (court AND prison) · Internal Security: detention without process · Internal Security: no legal infrastructure
        this pool is NOT one of them — here the source draws as any source
    court ← a bloc carrying `covert: true` (settlementPolitics)
        SYMPTOM: WHAT REACHES THE LAW AND WHAT IT DOES WITH IT — a court face on a legal-chain pool may hold that matters are heard as they should be, and may deny nothing else.
        marks the pools: Internal Security: full legal chain (court AND prison) · Internal Security: court without detention
        this pool is NOT one of them — here the source draws as any source
  ⛔ THE INVERTED TEST. A face tagged `compromised` is the ONE place the reassurance tell is the point (ruling 26 (a)), and FLOOR 1 IS RE-POINTED FOR IT ALONE (26 (b)): it may deny the VISIBLE SYMPTOM of the very field it is compromised by, in the direction of CONCEALMENT ONLY. It never denies an unrelated field, never a required row, and never names the covert fact. The archiver reports it as flatly as any account: no wink.
  ⛔ THE CONCEALMENT MUST NOT IDENTIFY (26 (f)): offer more than one shape — dismiss · reassure · minimise · change the subject · blame the source of the talk · say nothing beyond the form. An HONEST source may also reassure truthfully on a small share of honest towns, so a reassurance on the page is a question and never an answer.
  ⛔ AND THE SOURCE IS SILENT SOME OF THE TIME (26 (h)): where a compromised source is present on a marked pool, a roll seeded on the world seed, the pool key, the settlement and the CURRENT YEAR decides whether it speaks (0.7) or says nothing. Its silence is a behaviour, and the roll decides WHO SPEAKS and never WHAT IS TRUE.
  ⛔ THE TAG IS REFUSED on any source no covert field can compromise; the table is CLOSED: hall · watch · court.

  PLACEMENTS A FACE MAY NOT ASSERT — where a body STANDS, stated by the data at some preimage tiers and not others, or stated with a hedge
    Burial ground: "at the edge" — stated only at hamlet — silent at village, town   [the catalog row]
        the data says: "A walled plot at the edge of the settlement, gated against livestock and kept by the households in turn."
    Market square: "in the square" — stated only at town — silent at hamlet, village   [the `Civic announcements` service]
        the data says: "Official proclamations, wanted notices, and public notices read in the square."
    Parish burial grounds: "beyond the gate" — stated only at town — silent at hamlet, village   [the catalog row]
        the data says: "Each parish keeps its own ground beside its church, and a parish that has filled its ground buries beyond the gate instead."
  ⛔ A FACE DRAWS ON EVERY TOWN OF THE PREIMAGE, so a placement the data states only at the city is an INVENTION on the thorp (floor 2), and a hedged one is a tendency rather than this town's fact.

(2d) THE KEY'S SIBLING RUNGS — what this pool's key would have been had ONE of the fields it fixes been otherwise
    perimeter = false HERE
        perimeter = true -> `Beasts & Monsters: frontier, credible deterrence`
  ⛔ A FACE THAT READS AS A NEIGHBOURING RUNG IS A FLOOR-1 FINDING (ADDENDUM 18 ruling 35). These pools have their OWN faces and their own towns: a sentence here that would sit as comfortably on one of them is either saying nothing this key fixes, or is saying something this key fixes is FALSE. The refuter names the rung.

(7) THE UNIVERSAL SOURCES the required rows seat at each preimage tier (the marker adds the interests and the named offices)
  hamlet: the hall: — · the tavern: — · the guilds: — · the register (parish): Access to parish church, Burial ground · the elders: —
  village: the hall: — · the tavern: — · the guilds: — · the register (parish): Parish church, Priest (resident), Graveyard · the elders: —
  town: the hall: Town hall · the tavern: Taverns (5-20) · the guilds: Craft guilds (5-15) · the register (parish): Parish churches (2-5), Parish burial grounds · the elders: —
  the key on the force buckets and the gates: watch: OPEN · garrison: OPEN · militia: OPEN · mercenary: OPEN · charter: OPEN · gates: OPEN

(7) THE SOURCES

  ⛔⛔ READ THIS FIRST — FOUR CORRECTIONS TO THE INSTRUMENT'S OWN SECTIONS (4), (5), (2b) AND (7).

  (a) SECTION (5) PRINTS `walls OPEN`. IT IS NOT OPEN. Section (5) answers "does a required row
      seat it", and no required row seats walls at any tier. THE KEY FIXES IT: `defenseStateProse.js:712`
      passes `forces.walls.present` as the `perimeter` argument and `beastsRowSituation` (`:431-434`)
      reaches this pool ONLY on `perimeter === false`. The walls bucket is EMPTY on every town of the
      preimage — `wall`, `citadel`, `palisade`, `earthwork` (`defenseInstitutionBuckets.js:84-87`) all
      absent. Read section (5)'s walls line as "no required row seats it", NEVER as "a wall may be written".

  (b) AND THEREFORE THE GATE IS FIXED TOO, which section (5) also prints OPEN. `hasGates` fires on
      `gates` · `town walls` · `city walls` · `massive walls` · `palisade` (`priorityHelpers.js:53`),
      and the ONLY catalogue row carrying `gates` is `Gates (if walled)` (`institutionalCatalog.js:1358-1364`),
      which lands in the WALLS bucket because `wall` is a substring of `walled`. An empty walls bucket
      therefore leaves `hasGates` false on every town this pool can draw, and the same page says so in
      the engine's own hand: `safetyProfile.js:463-464` prints the lack of controlled entry points, with
      no gates to bribe and no checkpoints to avoid. ⇒ NOBODY HOLDS THE WAY THROUGH ON THIS POOL. That is
      the card's central fact and the whole of its difference from its one sibling rung.

  (c) SECTION (2b) PRINTS `Town watch … a face may not deny: Night patrol (p 1) · Gate duty (p 0.8)`
      ON A PREIMAGE WHERE NO TOWN HAS A GATE. The required `Town watch` row is "Part-time guards. Night
      patrol and gate duty." (`institutionalCatalog.js:1348-1354`) and its service menu turns Gate duty on
      at or above the bar, while `hasGates` is false at every town of this preimage and `safetyProfile.js:464`
      denies the checkpoints on the same page. THE CARD CONTRADICTS ITSELF HERE, not the writer. RULING FOR
      THIS BLOCK: the gate is NEITHER ASSERTED NOR DENIED by any face of this pool — not "the gate is barred
      at dusk" (F1-08, the assertion), not "there is no gate to stand at" (the (2b) service). Write the
      night patrol, which is unambiguous at town, and leave the gate out of the pool. REPORTED TO THE CHAIR
      as a wiring row: a required row's service menu asserting a facility the roster flag denies.

  (d) SECTION (4) LISTS `threatAssessment.js:74` AND `:80` — the two WALLED frontier strings — as
      CAN CO-FIRE. They reach this key ONLY THROUGH THE FROZEN/LIVE SEAM. `buildThreatAssessment` reads
      `d.institutions` (`threatAssessment.js:35`, `:40-42`), which is `defenseProfile.institutions`, a
      GENERATION-TIME SNAPSHOT with ZERO writers (section (6)); the key reads the LIVE, ruin-filtered
      roster. They are equal at generation and diverge only after a calamity throws the perimeter down.
      Under §R-1 and §R-2 THE FACE STANDS and the collision is a wiring row — a refuter may not fail a
      face of this pool for contradicting `:74` or `:80`. At generation the string that fires beside this
      key is `:86`, and it is the only one.

  ── WHAT THE KEY FIXES, AND WHAT THE ROSTER THEN SEATS, TIER BY TIER ──

  `defenseStateProse.js:712` — `beastsRowPoolKey(config.monsterThreat, walls, garrison || militia)`.
  THREE things and no more: `config.monsterThreat === 'frontier'`; the WALLS bucket EMPTY; the GARRISON
  bucket OR the MILITIA bucket NON-EMPTY. It does not fix WHICH of the two carries the force. The
  preimage is hamlet · village · town and is closed by the catalogue, not by the rate grid: THORP has no
  `Defense` category at all (`institutionalCatalog.js` seats Defense at `:334` hamlet, `:866` village,
  `:1331` town, `:1909` city, `:2346` metropolis), so no force row can ever resolve there; CITY and
  METROPOLIS carry `City walls and gates` as `required: true` (`:1909-1930`), so the perimeter can never
  be absent. 22 towns on the 768-town grid — hamlet 10, village 10, TOWN 2. ⭐ TWENTY OF THE TWENTY-TWO
  ARE BELOW TOWN. This is a SMALL-SETTLEMENT pool, and almost every institutional speaker is town-only.

  • HAMLET (10/22). The hamlet Defense category holds exactly two rows (`:334-349`): `Citizen militia`
    ("Able-bodied residents drill and muster against local threats. Part-time service.") and
    `Palisade or earthworks`. The key strikes the second. ⇒ ON A HAMLET OF THIS POOL THE FORCE IS A
    CITIZEN MILITIA AND THERE IS NO OTHER CANDIDATE. Required rows: parish-church ACCESS (the church
    does NOT stand here — "Walk 2-5km to village church", `:50-54`, `:300-305`), burial ground at the
    edge, dwellings, water source, external mill, subsistence farming, common grazing land. NO watch,
    NO hall, NO tavern, NO guild, NO market, NO granary, NO court on the required roster.
  • VILLAGE (10/22). Defense holds `Citizen militia` ("Organised community defense. Musters for raids
    and monster incursions."), `Palisade or earthworks` and `Veteran's lodge` (`:866-888`). The key
    strikes the palisade; the lodge sits in NO force bucket (`defenseInstitutionBuckets.js:98-100` wants
    `mercenary company` / `mercenary quarter` / `hired muscle`, and the flag list wants it — §1.4 W-01,
    the flag/bucket disagreement; NO FACE MAY BE CHARGED ON IT AND NONE WRITTEN ON IT). ⇒ THE FORCE IS
    AGAIN A CITIZEN MILITIA. Required: multiple water sources, dwellings, farmland, mill, PARISH CHURCH
    (it STANDS here), resident priest, graveyard. Still no watch, hall, tavern, guild, market, granary
    or court.
  • TOWN (2/22). `Town watch` is `required: true` AND carries `exclusiveGroup: 'civilianDefense'`, which
    `Citizen militia` shares (`:1340-1354`), SO A TOWN OF THIS POOL CANNOT HAVE A MILITIA (F1-26). The
    watch sits in the WATCH bucket only, never the garrison bucket (`defenseInstitutionBuckets.js:88-97`
    wants `professional city watch`, not `town watch`), so the watch does not satisfy the key either.
    ⇒ THE FORCE AT TOWN IS THE GARRISON BUCKET, AND THE ONLY GARRISON-BUCKET ROW AT TOWN IS `Barracks`
    ("Housing for guards or small garrison", `:1363-1369`). "The garrison" is lawful off it (§R-3).
    ⇒ EVERY TOWN OF THIS POOL CARRIES A PART-TIME TOWN WATCH AND A BARRACKS, AS TWO DISTINCT ROWS, AND
    NO WALL FOR EITHER TO STAND ON. Plus hall, market square, weekly market, craft guilds, inns,
    taverns, mills, parish churches, parish burial grounds, town granary — and `hasCourtSystem` true off
    the `Town hall` keyword (§R-4).

  ⇒ THE FORCE IS A DIFFERENT BODY AT EVERY TIER OF THE PREIMAGE AND THE BODY WORD IS UNUSABLE:
    "the militia" is false at town (F1-03, F1-26); "the garrison" is false at hamlet and village (F1-02);
    "the watch" is false at hamlet and village (F1-01, V-23) and true at town, so BOTH its assertion and
    its denial are findings at the pool grain. "THE MUSTER" is the class word and is free everywhere
    (F1-03), and so is "the guard" — `hasMilitaryInst` resolves on every town of this preimage, so
    `safetyProfile.js:300`/`:309` never print their denial here (§R-5, F1-04).

  ── UNIVERSAL (exists on every town this pool can draw) ──

  • THE ARCHIVER / THE OFFICE — the compiled dossier itself (`holderTable.js:78-84`, `OFFICE_KIND`).
    INTEREST: none, and that is its stake. ⛔ RULING 40: a fact the engine holds STANDS BARE in the
    archiver's hand — "There is no line around the place, and there are men who turn out." NEVER "the
    survey finds", "this office", "so far as the record goes". Its conjecture and its feeling live in
    the notebook, and its one observed face per variant is a bare passive with no observer named.

  • THE STRANGER / the traveller — the road kind (`holderTable.js:232-234`: `terrainType` and
    `monsterThreat` are the road's records), seated by no roster row. INTEREST, AND THIS POOL'S BEST
    GIFT: HE IS NOT STOPPED. Every other defense pool with a perimeter turns an entry service on and
    makes him state his business; here `hasGates` is false and the engine's own smuggling branch prints
    the lack of controlled entry points on the same tab (`safetyProfile.js:463-464`). He arrives, and
    the first thing that happens to him is nothing. `monsterThreat` is HIS record: the frontier is the
    road's fact, not the hall's.

  • THE MUSTER — universal as an INTEREST, never as a BODY WORD (above). INTEREST: it turns out, and it
    has nothing to turn out ONTO. The engine's own row beside it says defense is reactive and the
    attacker picks the ground (`threatAssessment.js:86`). ⚠ AND ITS PAY INTEREST IS ASYMMETRIC AND
    MOSTLY BARRED: at hamlet and village the force is a `Citizen militia`, of which NO wage, pay or
    arrears may be predicated at all (V-09; `institutionVocabulary.js:153-154` reads "no pay"; the rows'
    own descs read "Part-time service"), so a grievance about money is FALSE on 20 of the 22 towns; at
    town the `Barracks` sits on the one military purse (`defenseGenerator.js:182`, `:189-192`) where the
    gate language is licensed (F4-19). ⇒ THE HALL-VERSUS-MUSTER MONEY UNIT — the richest vein on every
    other defense pool — IS NOT AVAILABLE AT THIS POOL'S GRAIN. Do not reach for it.

  • THE PUBLIC `[public]` and THE ARCHIVER OBSERVING `[archiver · observed]` — always available, kept
    under NOTES until cars 18n land. The seeing must clear section (2b′): on this preimage armed men
    EXIST on every town, so "nobody has been seen under arms" is floor 1 in a witness's coat; at TOWN
    the required watch's `Night patrol` is at p 1, so "nobody walks the place at night" is floor 1
    there. What IS true on every town and is exactly what everyone saw at once: nobody was asked
    anything on the way in.

  • THE HOUSEHOLDS / the neighbours — not a seated body, the public's own plural. Free everywhere as
    "the townsfolk", "the households", "anyone here"; never "the elders" at town (F1-22).

  ── CONDITIONAL (and the field that seats each) ──

  • THE REGISTER / a house of the faith — ⛔ NOT UNIVERSAL, AND THE INSTRUMENT'S SECTION (7) IS WRONG
    ABOUT IT. It seats "the register (parish)" at HAMLET off `Access to parish church` and `Burial
    ground`. `faceSources.js:93` excludes exactly that row by prefix (`REGISTER_EXCLUDE_PREFIX = 'access
    to'` — a walk, not a register), and V-29 names "the parish register at a hamlet whose church is 2–5
    km away" as a standing floor-1 finding on F1-11. ⇒ THE REGISTER SPEAKS AT VILLAGE AND TOWN ONLY
    (`Parish church` + `Priest (resident)` at village; `Parish churches (2-5)` at town). AND ITS NAMED
    RECORD IS TOWN-ONLY: the parish kind wants `Register of the dead` / `Central register` / `Records`
    (`holderTable.js:296-302`), and on this preimage only the town's `Parish burial grounds` turns one on
    (section (2b), p 0.8). At village the register may SPEAK; it may not be CITED as a record (F1-24).
    INTEREST: the dead and the observance, and on a frontier without a line the burial ground is at the
    edge of the settlement (hamlet, `:334` placement) and beyond the gate at town — say neither where
    the other can draw (section (2c) placements).
  • THE HALL — `Town hall`, TOWN ONLY (2/22). ⛔ F1-20 bars a hall, chamber or council room as a PLACE
    below town, where the governing institution is a consensus and not a room. INTEREST: the purse, and
    at town it also seats the court (§R-4).
  • THE TAVERN — required at town (`Taverns (5-20)`, `Inn (multiple)`); below town only where the roster
    prints an `Alehouse` or a wayside inn (`:392-400`, optional). INTEREST: the safety label
    (`economicState.safetyProfile.safetyLabel`, FROZEN) and who actually turns out when the muster is called.
  • THE GUILDS — `Craft guilds (5-15)`, TOWN ONLY. INTEREST: what going out costs them against what
    staying in would.
  • THE WATCH — TOWN ONLY, and PART-TIME by its own row (F1-27: never professional, never full-time,
    never soldiers). INTEREST: it is paid from the same military gate the Barracks is (F4-19), and it is
    the body whose printed duty is gate duty on a town with no gate — see correction (c); write the
    night patrol and not the gate.
  • THE MARKET, THE GRANARY, THE COURT, THE MILLS — town and above only on this preimage (F1-09, F1-10,
    F1-12, F1-13). A village has a `Mill`; a hamlet has only ACCESS to an external one (F1-15).
  • THE ELDERS — BELOW TOWN ONLY, and as the engine's own small-tier label
    (`governanceNarrative.js:101-105`), never as a seated body with a room (F1-20, F1-22). ⚠ AND NEVER IN
    THE SINGULAR AT HAMLET: `Elder` is a TIER-MANDATORY NPC there (below).
  • THE CHARTER HALL and THE MERCENARY / free company — OPEN at town, absent from the catalogue below it
    (`institutionalCatalog.js:325`, `:837`; F1-06). Where a charter hall stands the page prints it in the
    engine's own hand beside this pool's row (`threatAssessment.js:88`). A face may neither assert nor
    deny it (F1-06, F1-30). ⚠ `Free company hall` and `Veteran's lodge` are §1.4 W-01 rows: no face may
    be charged on them and none written on them.
  • WHOEVER HOLDS THE WAY THROUGH — ⛔ NOT A SPEAKER ANYWHERE ON THIS POOL. There is no way through to
    hold (correction (b)). The toll-bar kind resolves to nobody here, so a toll book, a customs entry, a
    bar's take or an entry inspection cited as a record is F1-24 as well as F1-08.
  • THE CROWN'S ASSESSOR — NOT A SPEAKER. The engine has no typed crown collector anywhere.

  ── THE NAMED OFFICES A SPEAKER MUST NEVER BE (F3-06; `npcGenerator.js:1511-1537`) ──
    hamlet: ELDER · PARISH PRIEST        village: MAYOR · GUARD CAPTAIN
    town:   MAYOR · GUARD CAPTAIN · HIGH PRIEST
    AND BY STRESS, on a pool whose country is `frontier`: `monster_pressure` mandates a GARRISON
    COMMANDER and a RETIRED ADVENTURER (`:1530`) — the two people this pool's prose most wants to reach
    for. Also `under_siege` → Garrison Commander; `wartime` → Garrison Commander, Guild Master;
    `famine` / `mass_migration` → Healer, Guild Master; `occupied` / `insurgency` → Corrupt Official;
    `plague_onset` → Healer, Parish Priest; `indebted` → Moneylender.
    Use a plural, a trade or a bystander: "those who turn out", "one of the households that drills",
    "a man who keeps the barracks" — never "the captain", "the commander", "the elder", "the mayor".

(8) WHAT WOULD BE FALSE

  The claim that kills this pool is THE LINE, in every costume it wears, and the second is THE BODY WORD.
  The key fixes the walls bucket empty on all twenty-two towns, so a wall, a circuit, a perimeter, a ring,
  a rampart, a stockade, a bank, a ditch, a berm, an earthwork or "the line" is F1-07 outright — and a
  CITADEL is inner and a GATE is a point, so neither buys the writer a line either; and because every
  gate-setting row is itself a walls row, `hasGates` is false on every town, which puts a gate, a gatehouse,
  a bar, a checkpoint, a toll-bar, an entry inspection, a closing at dusk, "whoever keeps the way in", a
  toll book and a customs entry ALL under F1-08 and F1-24 at once, while the engine denies them in its own
  words on the same tab (`safetyProfile.js:463-464`) — and the DENIAL is barred too, by the required Town
  watch's own `Gate duty` service (section (2b), correction (c)), so the gate is simply not written here in
  either direction. Then the bodies: "the militia" is false at town (F1-03, F1-26 — `Town watch` is
  `required: true` and shares `exclusiveGroup: 'civilianDefense'`), "the garrison" is false at hamlet and
  village (F1-02 — no garrison-bucket row exists below town), "the watch" is false below town (F1-01,
  V-23) and required at town so its denial is false there (F1-25), a professional, full-time or soldierly
  watch is false at town (F1-27), a mercenary company is F1-05 and a charter hall F1-06, a hall or council
  room as a PLACE is false below town (F1-20), a church STANDING in the settlement is false at hamlet
  (F1-11, V-29 — the row is a walk of 2–5 km), the parish register as a cited record is false anywhere but
  town (F1-24), and a granary, a market, a guild, a courthouse, a gaol, a warehouse or a hospital as a
  building is false on twenty of the twenty-two (F1-09, F1-10, F1-16, F1-12, F1-13, F1-19, F1-14). The
  NEGATION direction is the same trap turned round (F1-25): "no force worth the name", "nobody musters",
  "there is no guard here", "nobody is set up to respond" are FALSE on every town — the key fixes force
  present, `hasMilitaryInst` resolves, and at town a Town watch and a Town hall are both required; this is
  the sitting's own named failure mode, a body inferred into a key's silence that a required row denies.
  A tier word is F1-31 (the preimage spans three tiers; write around it), a minted proper name F1-126, and
  a face that would sit as comfortably on `Beasts & Monsters: frontier, credible deterrence` — the one
  sibling rung (section (2d)) — is saying nothing this key fixes (ruling 35). On FLOOR 2 the standing
  temptations of a beast frontier are exactly the barred ones: a RATE is the likeliest breach on this desk
  ("most nights", "every spring", "they bring the stock in at dusk", "seldom", "more often than not" —
  F2-06, and the chair's own ADDENDUM 14 example is withdrawn in its rate form), then a MAGNITUDE (a
  headcount on the muster, a distance to the treeline, "a handful", "a day out" — F2-01), a DATE or
  DURATION (F2-02), a RAISING or a founding narrated ("they never finished the ditch", "the palisade was
  begun" — F2-03), an EVENT the record did not run ("the raid last winter", "the stockade burned", "they
  lost the outlying farm" — F2-04), an AGE of fabric (F2-07), a TREND (F2-08) and any allusion to the
  town's past, since this key reads no history field (F2-09). ⭐ BUT THE PERFECT AND THE DURATIVE ARE
  LICENSED HERE, WIDELY, and the writers should use them: ruling 11 licenses elapsed course over THE POOL
  KEY'S OWN READS — `config.monsterThreat` (FROZEN, zero writers) and the perimeter's absence and the
  force's presence, which a face is drawn only while they hold — so "no line has ever been drawn round
  the place" and "the muster has always gone out to meet it" are lawful, as is elapsed course over every
  FROZEN field section (6) names (`safetyLabel`, `guardEffectivenessDesc`, `readiness.score`, the
  `scores.*`, `economicGates.military`, the `compound.inst.*` civic flags, `stress`, `tier`,
  `structureKey`, `tradeRouteAccess`, `magicWorksAt`, `standingDefenseForces`); it is REFUSED over the
  LIVE reads — the roster at large (`institutions`, 38 writers), `name`, `defenseProfile`,
  `defenseProfile.scores`, `scores.disaster` — so "the mill has ground since" and "the granary has stood"
  are F2-05 while "nobody has ever stood a line here" is not. FLOOR 3: no named character's fate (F3-01),
  nothing predicated of a deity — the followers act (F3-02), no cultural furniture the profile denies
  (F3-05; ⚠ and note the hamlet's own `Dwellings (17-80)` desc reads "Timber-frame with thatched roofs",
  which is the ENGINE's sentence and not the writer's licence: eleven profiles ship and five of them have
  no thatch), and no act on an office the tier emits as a named NPC (F3-06; the full list is in (7), and
  ELDER at hamlet is the one writers forget). FLOOR 4: no decay clock and no permanence on any fabric
  (F4-01), one purse and one direction across the four gates (F4-02, F4-03), no total collapse of pay
  (F4-04) — and V-09 goes further on twenty of the twenty-two towns, where the force is a `Citizen
  militia` of which no wage, arrears or late money may be predicated AT ALL; `frontier` is not `plagued`
  and neither is disease (F4-05), the readiness band is not explained by the works (F4-06), a river or
  coast helps the defence rather than nothing (F4-07), and no covert fact reaches a player face (F4-13) —
  though section (2c) prints this pool as marked by NO compromised source, so every source here draws as
  any source and the `compromised` tag is refused. TWO LAST ONES, BOTH EASY TO WALK INTO: the same tab
  carries `safetyLabel` and `guardEffectivenessDesc` OPEN across the whole preimage, so a face that makes
  the town's FEAR or its unsafety a fact can be printed beside "among the safest settlements in the
  region. Visitors can move freely at all hours." (`safetyProfile.js:277`) or beside a militia the machine
  calls well-organized and motivated (`:353`) — F1-107, one band denying another on the same screen; and a
  face may not SETTLE the force's competence in either direction, because `:353` and `:356` can both fire.
  ⛔ AND THE WHOLE "UNLICENSED CLAIM" CLASS IS DEAD: if a finding's ground is "the card does not license
  it", there is no finding.

(9) WHERE THE FLAVOUR IS

  WHAT IS IN USE. The drill and the muster are the engine's own words at hamlet and village ("Able-bodied
  residents drill and muster", "Musters for raids and monster incursions"), so there is a place the
  households gather, a signal that gathers them, and their own tools in their own hands; at town there is a
  Barracks — housing for guards, built for men who have no wall to stand on — and a part-time watch that
  walks the place at night. The force is REAL and it is IN USE; what it lacks is not people but ground.
  The concrete objects the required rows put under it are the outlying ones: the common grazing land and
  the subsistence fields and the water source at hamlet, the farmland and the mill and the graveyard at
  village, the granary and the market square and the mills at town, and the burial ground that sits at the
  edge of the settlement where the dwellings stop.

  WHAT IS IN DISPUTE. Not money — the pay quarrel is barred on twenty of the twenty-two towns (V-09) and
  the hall that would hold the purse exists on only two. The dispute this pool actually owns is DIRECTION:
  the engine's own line beside it says the defence is reactive and the attacker chooses the point
  (`threatAssessment.js:86`), so the argument is about which way to go out and what is worth going out for
  — whose stock, whose field, whose mill, how far from the last house anyone is obliged to walk. At village
  the register and the households can differ over the graveyard beyond the fields; at town the guilds can
  count what going out costs them while the hall counts what staying in would; everywhere the tavern has an
  account of who actually turned out last time and the muster has its own.

  WHAT THE ABSENCE LOOKS LIKE. It is not a ruin and not a gap: nothing was thrown down and nothing was
  left unfinished, so it must be written as a standing condition and never as a history (F2-03, F2-04).
  There is simply nothing to close, nothing to man, nothing to bar, and no wrong side of anything — the
  settlement ends where the dwellings end. The stranger's version is the sharpest and the engine says it
  itself: he walks in and nobody asks him anything, because there are no gates to bribe and no checkpoints
  to avoid. Write the absence through what the people DO instead — where they put themselves, what they
  keep close, which way they look — and never through a rate, a count or a night ("at dusk", "most nights",
  "every spring" are all F2-06).
