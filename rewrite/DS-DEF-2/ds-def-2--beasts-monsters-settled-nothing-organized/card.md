  ⛔ A SERVICE AT OR ABOVE THE BAR IS A THING THE TOWN'S OWN MODEL SAYS THIS BODY DOES: denying it is floor 1, whatever the face is otherwise about. A row filed under `standing` is UNDER ARMS in the engine's reading even where the key fixes no garrison and no militia.

  ⛔ AN OBSERVATION AND A PUBLIC FACE ARE FACTS THEIR SPEAKER CLAIMS (rulings 27 (a), 28 (a)), so neither may INFER INTO A SILENCE a required row denies. On a preimage carrying a `Town watch`, "no member of the watch has walked the wall" is floor 1 in a witness's coat; "no soldier has been seen on the wall" is true on every town that draws a key fixing no garrison and no militia. The PUBLIC's second half — what everyone MAKES of what it saw — is a perception and may be mistaken; the seeing may not.
  ⛔ AND THE FAIR COPY DOES NOT CITE ITSELF (ADDENDUM 18 ruling 40, the owner's): an observation is a BARE PASSIVE with no observer named — never "in the survey's time here", "on the nights the survey kept", "it is observed that", "this office".

(2c) COVERT FIELDS AND THEIR SYMPTOMS ON THIS BLOCK (ADDENDUM 18 ruling 26) — the INVERTED test the refuter judges a `compromised` face under
    hall ← powerStructure.criminalCaptureState at `corrupted` or `capture`
        SYMPTOM: THE PURSE AND THE ACCOUNTS — what the hall says the town's money does, and who decides it. DS-DEF-4 says the fact outright ("the hall's decisions are not the hall's"), so a hall face on a purse pool may reassure that the accounts are in order and may deny NOTHING ELSE.
        marks the pools: Invasion & War: walls with NO force · Economic Survival: STRONG · Economic Survival: ADEQUATE · Economic Survival: WEAK
        this pool is NOT one of them — here the source draws as any source
    watch ← a bloc carrying `covert: true` (settlementPolitics)
        SYMPTOM: THE WATCH'S OWN KEEPING — the circuit, the wage, who is on the walk after dark. A watch face on an internal-security pool may say the patrol is kept as it has always been kept, and may deny nothing about the court, the purse or the walls.
        marks the pools: Internal Security: full legal chain (court AND prison) · Internal Security: detention without process · Internal Security: no legal infrastructure
        this pool is NOT one of them — here the source draws as any source
    court ← a bloc carrying `covert: true` (settlementPolitics)
        SYMPTOM: WHAT REACHES THE LAW AND WHAT IT DOES WITH IT — a court face on a legal-chain pool may hold that matters are heard as they should be, and may deny nothing else.
        marks the pools: Internal Security: full legal chain (court AND prison) · Internal Security: court without detention
        this pool is NOT one of them — here the source draws as any source
  ⛔ THE INVERTED TEST. A face tagged `compromised` is the ONE place the reassurance tell is the point (ruling 26 (a)), and FLOOR 1 IS RE-POINTED FOR IT ALONE (26 (b)): it may deny the VISIBLE SYMPTOM of the very field it is compromised by, in the direction of CONCEALMENT ONLY. It never denies an unrelated field, never a required row, and never names the covert fact. The archiver reports it as flatly as any account: no wink.
  ⛔ THE CONCEALMENT MUST NOT IDENTIFY (26 (f)): offer more than one shape — dismiss · reassure · minimise · change the subject · blame the source of the talk · say nothing beyond the form. An HONEST source may also reassure truthfully on a small share of honest towns, so a reassurance on the page is a question and never an answer.
  ⛔ AND THE SOURCE IS SILENT SOME OF THE TIME (26 (h)): where a compromised source is present on a marked pool, a roll seeded on the world seed, the pool key, the settlement and the CURRENT YEAR decides whether it speaks (0.7) or says nothing. Its silence is a behaviour, and the roll decides WHO SPEAKS and never WHAT IS TRUE.
  ⛔ THE TAG IS REFUSED on any source no covert field can compromise; the table is CLOSED: hall · watch · court.

  PLACEMENTS A FACE MAY NOT ASSERT — where a body STANDS, stated by the data at some preimage tiers and not others, or stated with a hedge
    Burial ground: "at the edge" — stated only at hamlet — silent at thorp, village, town   [the catalog row]
        the data says: "A walled plot at the edge of the settlement, gated against livestock and kept by the households in turn."
    Market square: "in the square" — stated only at town — silent at thorp, hamlet, village   [the `Civic announcements` service]
        the data says: "Official proclamations, wanted notices, and public notices read in the square."
    Parish burial grounds: "beyond the gate" — stated only at town — silent at thorp, hamlet, village   [the catalog row]
        the data says: "Each parish keeps its own ground beside its church, and a parish that has filled its ground buries beyond the gate instead."
  ⛔ A FACE DRAWS ON EVERY TOWN OF THE PREIMAGE, so a placement the data states only at the city is an INVENTION on the thorp (floor 2), and a hedged one is a tendency rather than this town's fact.

(2d) THE KEY'S SIBLING RUNGS — what this pool's key would have been had ONE of the fields it fixes been otherwise
    monsterThreat = "heartland" HERE
        monsterThreat = "plagued" -> `Beasts & Monsters: plagued, NO perimeter and NO force`
    perimeter = false HERE
        perimeter = true -> `Beasts & Monsters: settled, defenses beyond the need`
  ⛔ A FACE THAT READS AS A NEIGHBOURING RUNG IS A FLOOR-1 FINDING (ADDENDUM 18 ruling 35). These pools have their OWN faces and their own towns: a sentence here that would sit as comfortably on one of them is either saying nothing this key fixes, or is saying something this key fixes is FALSE. The refuter names the rung.

THE MARKER'S SECTIONS (seat: opus) — written against the instrument above, ADDENDUM 18,

════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

(7) THE SOURCES

  ── FOUR CORRECTIONS TO THE MECHANICAL SECTIONS, READ THESE FIRST ──

  (a) ⛔⛔ THE POOL IS TWO POPULATIONS AND THE INSTRUMENT'S FLAT TIER LIST HIDES IT. The key
      reads the LIVE roster (`defenseStateProse.js:655-660` → `standingDefenseForces`, called at
      `:712` as `beastsRowPoolKey(config.monsterThreat, walls, garrison || militia)`), and it
      consults THREE buckets only — walls, garrison, militia. It does NOT consult the watch
      bucket. At TOWN, `Town watch` is `required: true` ("Part-time guards. Night patrol and gate
      duty.", `institutionalCatalog.js:1348-1354`), sits in the WATCH bucket only
      (`defenseInstitutionBuckets.js:84-87` wants `town watch`, not a garrison keyword), and is
      filed UNDER ARMS by `deriveArmedForces` (section (2b)). It also sets `hasMilitaryInst`,
      which matches the bare substring `'watch'` (`priorityHelpers.js:45`).
      ⇒ 102 OF THE 116 TOWNS (thorp 28 · hamlet 36 · village 38) CARRY NO DEFENSIVE BODY OF ANY
        KIND ON A REQUIRED ROW, AND THE MACHINE PRINTS THE ABSENCE IN ITS OWN WORDS
        (`safetyProfile.js:380` "There is no formal enforcement body…"; `:442`, `:452`).
      ⇒ 14 OF THEM (town) CARRY A REQUIRED PART-TIME WATCH AND A REQUIRED TOWN HALL, AND THE
        MACHINE PRINTS THE WATCH KEEPING PATROL BESIDE THE FACE (`safetyProfile.js:372` "The
        watch maintains standard patrol coverage"; `:284` "The watch is present and responsive").
      ⇒ NEITHER THE BODY NOR ITS DENIAL IS WRITABLE AT THE POOL GRAIN. This is the sitting's own
        named failure mode, and THE SHIPPED SPINE OF THIS VERY POOL WALKS INTO IT: "meets nothing
        that would justify a watch" (`f2da5a3ee:docs/content/RECEIPT_POOLS_DOSSIER_STATE.md:2628`)
        is false on the fourteen towns where a watch is required.

  (b) THERE IS NO GATE AND NO LINE ON ANY OF THE 116, AND THE GATE MAY NOT BE DENIED EITHER.
      Every walls-bucket row of the preimage is excluded by the key — thorp `Palisade` (`:97`),
      hamlet and village `Palisade or earthworks` (`:344`, `:876`), town `Town walls` (`:1336`).
      `Gates (if walled)` (`:1360`) carries `wall` inside its own name, so it lands in the WALLS
      bucket too and the key excludes it: `hasGates` is FALSE on every town this pool draws.
      F1-08 bars a gate, a bar, a checkpoint, a toll-bar, a closing at dusk — **and its denial** —
      and at town the required watch's own `Gate duty` service is on at p 0.8 (section (2b);
      W-08 is the wiring row). ⇒ THE GATE IS NOT WRITTEN HERE IN EITHER DIRECTION.

  (c) THE REGISTER IS NOT UNIVERSAL AND THE INSTRUMENT'S SECTION (7) IS WRONG ABOUT IT TWICE.
      It seats "the register (parish)" at THORP off `Burial ground` and at HAMLET off `Access to
      parish church`. `faceSources.js:91-93` resolves a register only where a church, cathedral,
      temple, abbey, monastery or friary STANDS, and excludes the prefix `access to` by name (a
      walk of 2–5 km, not a register); V-29 names the hamlet register as a standing F1-11 finding.
      A burial ground is not a house of the faith. ⇒ THE REGISTER SPEAKS AT VILLAGE AND TOWN ONLY.

  (d) ⛔ THE NAMED RECORD IS BARRED OUTRIGHT ON THIS POOL, BY THE PROVENANCE RULE ITSELF. A named
      record is licensed only where the card names it for this key AND the pool's shipped rows
      already cited one. The shipped three spines cite NO record — no roll, no toll book, no
      register, no accounts, no books. ⇒ EVERY ACCOUNT HERE NAMES ITS SOURCE THROUGH A ROLE AND
      NEVER THROUGH A RECORD. And independently: the muster kind resolves to NOBODY on all 116
      (its only holder is `Citizen militia`, `holderTable.js:279-288`, which the key excludes) and
      the toll-bar kind resolves to nobody (no gate anywhere), so a muster roll or a toll book
      here is F1-24 as well.

  ── THE FORCE-WORD MAP, TIER BY TIER (the words, and where each one is false) ──

  • "the walls", "the line", "a perimeter", "a ring", "a rampart", "a stockade", "a bank", "a
    ditch", "an earthwork" — FALSE ON ALL 116 (F1-07). A citadel is inner and a gate is a point;
    neither buys a line. `Palisade or earthworks` is a walls row and is excluded by the key.
  • "the garrison" — FALSE ON ALL 116 (F1-02). The only garrison-bucket row anywhere in the
    preimage is the town's `Barracks` (`:1363`, `required: false`), which DOES license the word
    where it stands (§R-3) — and the key excludes it.
  • "the militia" — FALSE ON ALL 116 by the key; and at town it could not stand anyway, since
    `Citizen militia` (`:1340`) shares `exclusiveGroup: 'civilianDefense'` with the required
    `Town watch` (F1-26).
  • "the watch" — TRUE AT TOWN (14), FALSE BELOW IT (102) — F1-01 and V-23 on the assertion,
    F1-25 on the denial. BOTH DIRECTIONS ARE FINDINGS AT THE POOL GRAIN. And at town it is
    PART-TIME by its own row: never professional, never full-time, never soldiers (F1-27).
  • "the guard" — SPLIT the same way. `hasMilitaryInst` is TRUE at town (the watch), FALSE at
    thorp always (no charter row exists there), and below town turns entirely on whether a
    charter hall stands. So `safetyProfile.js:442`'s "There is no meaningful guard presence." and
    `:452`'s "There is effectively no law enforcement." can print beside a face on the hundred and
    two, and cannot at town.
  • "the muster" — the class word is free (F1-03) and THERE IS NOTHING IT NAMES. Unlike the
    frontier rungs, this pool has no force row on any tier. The one exception is the thorp's
    optional `Household levy` (`:104`, `required: false`, "One able-bodied adult from each
    household musters with hunting bows, spears, and farm tools when danger reaches the fields"),
    which sits in NO defense bucket and is therefore NOT excluded by this key (W-02 is the wiring
    row, and it is about DS-DEF-5's six-bucket key, not this one). ⇒ A face asserting a turning-out
    is false on the towns with no levy; a face denying that anyone would turn out at all is false
    on the thorps that carry one. ⛔ AND V-09 BARS THE MONEY HALF OUTRIGHT: no wage, pay or
    arrears may be predicated of a `Household levy` at all.
  • a MERCENARY company — F1-05, and no mercenary row exists below town.
  • a CHARTER HALL — OPEN at hamlet (`:325`, 0.12), village (`:837`, 0.20) and town (`:1443`,
    0.30); no row at thorp. Neither assert nor deny (F1-06, F1-30). Where one stands,
    `threatAssessment.js:96` fires instead of `:98`, so even the machine's "no organized defense"
    line is not guaranteed beside the face.

  ── UNIVERSAL (exists on every town this pool can draw) ──

  • THE ARCHIVER / THE OFFICE — the compiled dossier itself (`holderTable.js:78-84`, `OFFICE_KIND`).
    INTEREST: none, and that is its stake. ⛔ RULING 40: a fact the engine holds STANDS BARE in the
    archiver's own hand. NEVER "the survey finds", "this office", "so far as the record goes". Its
    conjecture and its feeling live in the notebook; its one observed face per variant is a bare
    passive with no observer named.

  • THE STRANGER / the traveller — the road kind (`holderTable.js:232-234`: `terrainType` and
    `monsterThreat` ARE the road's records), seated by no roster row. INTEREST, AND THIS POOL'S
    OWN GIFT, WHICH IS THE EXACT INVERSE OF THE FRONTIER RUNGS': he is not stopped, and there was
    nothing out there that would have stopped him either. `monsterThreat` is HIS record and on
    this key it reads calm. He arrives, nothing happens to him, and nobody counts it remarkable.

  • THE HOUSEHOLDS / the neighbours — not a seated body, the public's own plural. Free everywhere
    as "the townsfolk", "the households", "anyone here". ⚠ never "the elders" at town (F1-22),
    never in the singular where the tier mandates an Elder (thorp, hamlet).

  • THE PUBLIC `[public]` and THE ARCHIVER OBSERVING `[archiver · observed]` — always available,
    kept under NOTES until cars 18n/18o land. The seeing must clear section (2b′): at TOWN the
    required watch's `Night patrol` is at p 1, so "nobody walks the place after dark" is floor 1
    in a witness's coat there; at every tier a burial is at p 1 and the parish services at or above
    the bar. WHAT IS TRUE ON ALL 116 AND IS EXACTLY WHAT EVERYONE SAW AT ONCE: there is no line
    round the place and nobody was stopped coming in.

  ── CONDITIONAL (and the field that seats each) ──

  • THE HALL — `Town hall`, TOWN ONLY (14/116). ⛔ F1-20 bars a hall, chamber or council room as a
    PLACE below town, where the governing institution is a consensus and not a room
    (`institutionalCatalog.js:8-40`: `Head-of-household consensus`, `Informal elder consensus`,
    `Household elder`, `Lord's reeve`). INTEREST: the purse, and at town it also seats the court
    (`hasCourtSystem` fires off the `town hall` keyword, §R-4 — the WORD is free, the criminal
    procedure is F1-12).
  • THE TAVERN — required at town (`Taverns (5-20)`, `Inn (multiple)`); below town only where an
    `Alehouse` (`:391`, 0.55, "The hamlet's main gathering place. News, disputes, and arrangements
    all happen here.") or a `Wayside inn` (`:397`) stands. INTEREST: `safetyLabel` (FROZEN) and
    what the place is like after dark.
  • THE GUILDS — `Craft guilds (5-15)`, TOWN ONLY. INTEREST: what the town spends on keeping
    nothing, against what it spends on them.
  • THE REGISTER / a house of the faith — VILLAGE and TOWN only (correction (c)). At village it is
    `Parish church` + `Priest (resident)`; at town `Parish churches (2-5)`. INTEREST: the dead and
    the observance — and note the placements section (2c) bars: the burial ground is stated "at the
    edge" only at hamlet and "beyond the gate" only at town, so neither placement is writable where
    the other tier can draw the face. ⛔ AND THE REGISTER MAY NOT BE CITED AS A RECORD ANYWHERE
    HERE (correction (d)).
  • THE WATCH — TOWN ONLY (14/116), PART-TIME by its own row (F1-27). It is on the military purse
    (F4-19: `hasAnyDefense` counts `hasWatch`, `defenseGenerator.js:177-178`, `:189-191`), and
    `defenseProfile.economicGates.military` is FROZEN, so the perfect is licensed over its pay.
    ⚠ THIS IS THE POOL'S ONLY MONEY VEIN AND IT EXISTS ON FOURTEEN OF A HUNDRED AND SIXTEEN TOWNS.
    Do not build the block on it.
  • THE ELDERS — BELOW TOWN ONLY, as the engine's own small-tier label
    (`governanceNarrative.js:101-105`), never as a seated body with a room (F1-20, F1-22).
  • THE MARKET, THE GRANARY, THE COURT, THE MILLS — town and above only on this preimage (F1-10,
    F1-09, F1-12, F1-15). A village has a `Mill`; a hamlet and a thorp have only `Access to external
    mill` — "must travel to the manor mill".
  • WHOEVER HOLDS THE WAY THROUGH — ⛔ NOT A SPEAKER ANYWHERE ON THIS POOL (correction (b)).
  • THE MUSTER — ⛔ NOT A SPEAKER ON THIS POOL. See the force-word map.
  • THE CROWN'S ASSESSOR — NOT A SPEAKER. The engine has no typed crown collector anywhere.

  ── THE NAMED OFFICES A SPEAKER MUST NEVER BE (F3-06; `npcGenerator.js:1511-1537`) ──
    thorp:   ELDER + a derived second role (`deriveThorpSecondRole`)
    hamlet:  ELDER · PARISH PRIEST
    village: MAYOR · GUARD CAPTAIN
    town:    MAYOR · GUARD CAPTAIN · HIGH PRIEST
    ⚠ VILLAGE AND TOWN BOTH EMIT A GUARD CAPTAIN — on a preimage with no force at village and a
    part-time watch at town. That is the person this pool's prose most wants to reach for, and he
    is on the next tab with a personality and a secret.
    AND BY STRESS: `monster_pressure` mandates a GARRISON COMMANDER and a RETIRED ADVENTURER and
    CAN FIRE ON A HEARTLAND TOWN (`stressGenerator.js:121` multiplies monster stress DOWN, never
    to zero); `indebted` → Moneylender; `famine` / `mass_migration` → Healer, Guild Master;
    `plague_onset` → Healer, Parish Priest; `occupied` / `insurgency` → Corrupt Official;
    `wartime` / `under_siege` / `slave_revolt` → Garrison Commander.
    Use a plural, a trade or a bystander: "the households", "a woman who keeps bees at the fence
    line", "whoever is nearest" — never "the captain", "the elder", "the mayor", "the priest".

(8) WHAT WOULD BE FALSE

  The claim that kills this pool is THE TOTALITY OF SAFETY, and the second is THE BODY WORD IN
  EITHER DIRECTION. `settled` is `heartland` and it does not mean nothing threatens the place: it
  MULTIPLIES threat DOWN and only down (monster ×0.3, occupation ×0.4, war ×0.4,
  `stressGenerator.js:121`, `:168`, `:231`), `monsterThreat.js:20-28` calls it "the calm baseline",
  and `threatAssessment.js:113-130` builds an `Invasion & War` row for EVERY town and renders it at
  `DefenseTab.jsx:150-183` — so "nothing threatens here", "there is no danger", "nothing comes out
  of the country" are F1-34 outright, and the `monster_pressure` stress can fire on a heartland town
  and print "Monster pressure from the surrounding region has changed how the settlement operates
  after dark" (`safetyProfile.js:197`) directly beside the face. Ease AT THE TOWN'S OWN GRAIN is
  free; a verdict on the world is not. Then the bodies, and they are barred BOTH WAYS: "the watch"
  is false on the hundred and two below town (F1-01, V-23) and REQUIRED on the fourteen towns, so
  "nobody is set up to respond", "nothing here would justify a watch", "there is no guard", "no
  force worth the name" are F1-25 on those fourteen — this is the sitting's own named failure mode
  and the SHIPPED spine of this pool commits it; "the garrison" is false everywhere (F1-02),
  "the militia" everywhere (F1-03, and F1-26 at town), a mercenary company F1-05, a wall, line,
  ring, rampart, palisade, bank or ditch everywhere (F1-07), and a gate, bar, checkpoint, toll-bar
  or closing at dusk — AND THE DENIAL OF ONE — everywhere (F1-08, correction (b), W-08). A charter
  hall may be neither asserted nor denied (F1-06, F1-30); a hall, chamber or council room as a
  place is false below town (F1-20); a church STANDING is false at hamlet and thorp (F1-11, V-29);
  a granary, market, guildhall, courthouse, gaol, warehouse or hospital as a BUILDING is false on a
  hundred and two of the hundred and sixteen (F1-09, F1-10, F1-16, F1-12, F1-13, F1-19, F1-14);
  a criminal trial, sentence or gallows is F1-12 even at town, where only a civil procedure is
  recorded; a tier word is F1-31 (four tiers in the preimage — write around it); a minted proper
  name is F1-126; and a named record of any kind — a roll, a toll book, the register, the accounts,
  "the books" — is F1-24 AND barred by the provenance rule, which is stricter here than the floors
  (correction (d)). A face that would sit as comfortably on `Beasts & Monsters: settled, defenses
  beyond the need` — the one perimeter sibling rung, section (2d) — is saying nothing this key
  fixes (ruling 35). ⛔ AND THE SHARPEST TRAP ON THIS DESK IS F1-107, BECAUSE THIS KEY READS THE
  MONSTER FAMILY AND TWO EMPTY BUCKETS AND NOTHING ELSE: `safetyLabel` and `guardEffectivenessDesc`
  are OPEN across the whole preimage, so a face that makes the town's quiet or its trust a FACT can
  print beside `Dangerous — Criminal Governance` (`safetyProfile.js:248`), beside "Violence and
  theft are routine" (`:313`), beside "There is effectively no law enforcement" (`:452`) or beside
  `Controlled — Authoritarian` (`:241`) — one band denying another on one screen. ⇒ A FACE MAY NOT
  SETTLE THE TOWN'S SAFETY, ITS ORDER OR ITS EASE IN EITHER DIRECTION; it may only say what a source
  makes of the country outside, which is what this key actually fixes. On FLOOR 2 the standing
  temptations of a quiet heartland are exactly the barred ones: a RATE is the likeliest breach on
  this desk ("most nights", "every spring", "the stock comes in at dusk", "seldom", "more often than
  not" — F2-06, and the chair's own ADDENDUM 14 example is withdrawn in its rate form), then a
  MAGNITUDE ("a handful", "a day's walk", a headcount, a distance to anything — F2-01), a DATE or
  DURATION (F2-02), a RAISING or a founding narrated ("they never built one", "the palisade came
  down" — F2-03), an EVENT the record did not run ("the last time anything came", "nothing has come
  since the raid" — F2-04), an AGE of fabric (F2-07), a TREND (F2-08), and any allusion to the
  town's past, since this key reads no history field (F2-09). ⭐ BUT THE PERFECT AND THE DURATIVE
  ARE LICENSED HERE, WIDELY, AND THE WRITERS SHOULD USE THEM: ruling 11 licenses elapsed course over
  THE POOL KEY'S OWN READS — `config.monsterThreat` (FROZEN, zero writers under `worldPulse/`) and
  the absence of the perimeter and the absence of the force, which a face is drawn only while they
  hold — so "no line has ever been drawn round the place" and "nobody has ever been asked to stand
  on anything" are lawful, and so is the shipped spine's own "The town has never needed to think
  about what is outside it" PROVIDED it attaches to the key's read and not to the town's history.
  Elapsed course is likewise licensed over every FROZEN field section (6) names — `safetyLabel`,
  `guardEffectivenessDesc`, `readiness.score`, the `scores.*`, `economicGates.military` and
  `economicGates.[*]`, the `compound.inst.*` civic flags, `stress`, `tier`, `structureKey`,
  `tradeRouteAccess`, `magicWorksAt`, `standingDefenseForces`, the `defenseProfile.institutions.*`
  snapshot — and REFUSED over the LIVE reads: the roster at large (`institutions`, 38 writers),
  `name` (201), `defenseProfile` (1), `defenseProfile.scores` (1), `scores.disaster` (1). So "the
  mill has ground since" and "the granary has stood" are F2-05 while "nothing has ever stood round
  this place" is not. FLOOR 3: no named character's fate (F3-01); nothing predicated of a deity, the
  followers act (F3-02); no cultural furniture the profile denies (F3-05 — eleven profiles ship, and
  this pool's pastoral quiet is the single strongest pull toward thatch, the churchyard, the market
  green and the hedge, none of which five of the eleven have; note that the hamlet's own
  `Dwellings (17-80)` desc reads "Timber-frame with thatched roofs", which is the ENGINE's sentence
  and not the writer's licence); and no act on an office the tier emits as a named NPC (F3-06 — the
  GUARD CAPTAIN at village and town is the one this pool's prose reaches for). FLOOR 4: no decay
  clock and no permanence on any fabric (F4-01, and the purse's own closure path reaches
  `required: false` rows, §V.0 floor 4); one purse and one direction across the four gates (F4-02,
  F4-03); no total collapse of pay (F4-04) — and on 102 of the 116 there is nothing to pay at all,
  while V-09 bars a wage, pay or arrears on the thorp's `Household levy` outright; `heartland` is
  not `plagued` and neither is disease (F4-05); the readiness band is not explained by the works
  (F4-06); a river or coast helps the defence rather than nothing (F4-07); and no covert fact
  reaches a player face (F4-13) — though section (2c) prints this pool as marked by NO compromised
  source, so every source draws as any source and the `compromised` tag is REFUSED here. ONE LAST
  SEAM WORTH KNOWING BEFORE YOU CHARGE ANYTHING: the key reads the LIVE buckets while the machine
  rows beside it read the generation-time snapshot (`defenseProfile.institutions.*`, section (3)'s
  ⚠ SEAM), so a calamity-flattened town can draw this pool while `threatAssessment.js:115` still
  prints "Walls and professional garrison provide meaningful deterrence" above it — §R-1 and §1.4
  govern: the face stands, the stale snapshot is not the record, and the refuter files a WIRING row
  rather than a finding. ⛔ AND THE WHOLE "UNLICENSED CLAIM" CLASS IS DEAD: if a finding's ground is
  "the card does not license it", there is no finding.

(9) WHERE THE FLAVOUR IS

  WHAT IS IN USE. Everything, and none of it is a defence — that is the pool's whole subject. The
  required rows are civilian to the last one: at thorp and hamlet the water source, the subsistence
  fields, the common grazing land, the burial ground, and a walk of two to five kilometres to
  somebody else's mill and somebody else's church; at village the farmland, the mill that is finally
  the village's own, the parish church with a priest who lives there, and the graveyard; at town the
  market square and the weekly market, the granary, the mills, the inns and the taverns, the craft
  guilds, the hall — and a part-time watch that walks the place at night and is the only body in the
  whole preimage that anyone could call out. The hands and the hours all go somewhere; they go into
  the harvest and the grinding and the burying and the selling, and the concrete objects a source
  can put in front of a reader are those.

  WHAT IS IN DISPUTE. Not the wall and not the wage: there is no wall on any of the hundred and
  sixteen, and on a hundred and two of them there is nobody to pay. What this pool actually owns is
  the question of WHETHER ANYTHING IS OWED — what the calm is worth, what it would cost to keep
  something against it, and who would be the first to know if it stopped. At town the guilds can
  count what the watch costs against what it does and the hall can count what it would cost to have
  more; the tavern has an account of what the place is like after dark and the register has an
  account of the ground it keeps ready; a stranger has an account of walking in unasked and of what
  that told him. And because the internal-order band is entirely open beside this key, the
  disagreement is real rather than decorative: one source's quiet is another's nobody-is-looking.

  WHAT THE ABSENCE LOOKS LIKE. It is not a ruin and not a gap: nothing was thrown down, nothing was
  begun, nothing was left unfinished, and nobody decided anything — so it must be written as a
  standing condition and never as a history or a choice (F2-03, F2-04, F2-09). The settlement simply
  ends where the dwellings end and the fields go on past it with no edge anywhere. Write it through
  what people do instead — how far from the last house a child is allowed to go, which way a person
  looks coming in off the fields, what is left out overnight and never brought in, what a household
  keeps by the door and what it does not — and never through a rate, a count, a night or a season,
  which are the two standing breaches on this desk.
