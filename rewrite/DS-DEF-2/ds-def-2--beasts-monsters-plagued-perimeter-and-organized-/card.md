  ⛔ A SERVICE AT OR ABOVE THE BAR IS A THING THE TOWN'S OWN MODEL SAYS THIS BODY DOES: denying it is floor 1, whatever the face is otherwise about. A row filed under `standing` is UNDER ARMS in the engine's reading even where the key fixes no garrison and no militia.

  ⛔ AN OBSERVATION AND A PUBLIC FACE ARE FACTS THEIR SPEAKER CLAIMS (rulings 27 (a), 28 (a)), so neither may INFER INTO A SILENCE a required row denies. On a preimage carrying a `Town watch`, "no member of the watch has walked the wall" is floor 1 in a witness's coat; "no soldier has been seen on the wall" is true on every town that draws a key fixing no garrison and no militia. The PUBLIC's second half — what everyone MAKES of what it saw — is a perception and may be mistaken; the seeing may not.
  ⛔ AND THE FAIR COPY DOES NOT CITE ITSELF (ADDENDUM 18 ruling 40, the owner's): an observation is a BARE PASSIVE with no observer named — never "in the survey's time here", "on the nights the survey kept", "it is observed that", "this office".

(2c) COVERT FIELDS AND THEIR SYMPTOMS ON THIS BLOCK (ADDENDUM 18 ruling 26) — the INVERTED test the refuter judges a `compromised` face under
    hall ← powerStructure.criminalCaptureState at `corrupted` or `capture`
        SYMPTOM: THE PURSE AND THE ACCOUNTS — what the hall says the town's money does, and who decides it. DS-DEF-4 says the fact outright ("the hall's decisions are not the hall's"), so a hall face on a purse pool may reassure that the accounts are in order and may deny NOTHING ELSE.
        marks the pools: Invasion & War: walls with NO force · Economic Survival: STRONG · Economic Survival: ADEQUATE · Economic Survival: WEAK
        this pool is NOT one of them — here the source draws as any source
    watch ← a bloc carrying `covert: true` (settlementPolitics)
        SYMPTOM: THE WATCH'S OWN KEEPING — the circuit, the wage, who is on the walk after dark. A watch face on an internal-security pool may say the patrol is kept as it has always been kept, and may deny nothing about the court, the purse or the walls.
        marks the pools: Internal Security: full legal chain (court AND prison) · Internal Security: detention without process · Internal Security: no legal infrastructure
        this pool is NOT one of them — here the source draws as any source
    court ← a bloc carrying `covert: true` (settlementPolitics)
        SYMPTOM: WHAT REACHES THE LAW AND WHAT IT DOES WITH IT — a court face on a legal-chain pool may hold that matters are heard as they should be, and may deny nothing else.
        marks the pools: Internal Security: full legal chain (court AND prison) · Internal Security: court without detention
        this pool is NOT one of them — here the source draws as any source
  ⛔ THE INVERTED TEST. A face tagged `compromised` is the ONE place the reassurance tell is the point (ruling 26 (a)), and FLOOR 1 IS RE-POINTED FOR IT ALONE (26 (b)): it may deny the VISIBLE SYMPTOM of the very field it is compromised by, in the direction of CONCEALMENT ONLY. It never denies an unrelated field, never a required row, and never names the covert fact. The archiver reports it as flatly as any account: no wink.
  ⛔ THE CONCEALMENT MUST NOT IDENTIFY (26 (f)): offer more than one shape — dismiss · reassure · minimise · change the subject · blame the source of the talk · say nothing beyond the form. An HONEST source may also reassure truthfully on a small share of honest towns, so a reassurance on the page is a question and never an answer.
  ⛔ AND THE SOURCE IS SILENT SOME OF THE TIME (26 (h)): where a compromised source is present on a marked pool, a roll seeded on the world seed, the pool key, the settlement and the CURRENT YEAR decides whether it speaks (0.7) or says nothing. Its silence is a behaviour, and the roll decides WHO SPEAKS and never WHAT IS TRUE.
  ⛔ THE TAG IS REFUSED on any source no covert field can compromise; the table is CLOSED: hall · watch · court.

  PLACEMENTS A FACE MAY NOT ASSERT — where a body STANDS, stated by the data at some preimage tiers and not others, or stated with a hedge
    Burial ground: "at the edge" — stated only at hamlet — silent at village, town, city, metropolis   [the catalog row]
        the data says: "A walled plot at the edge of the settlement, gated against livestock and kept by the households in turn."
    Burial grounds and charnel house: "inside the walls" — stated only at city — silent at hamlet, village, town, metropolis   [the catalog row]
        the data says: "The parish grounds inside the walls filled generations ago, so the dead are lifted once their term is up and their bones stacked in the charnel house to make room for the next."
    Burial grounds and charnel house: "outside the gates" — stated only at city — silent at hamlet, village, town, metropolis   [the catalog row · the `Burial` service]
        the data says: "New ground has been bought outside the gates, and the carts that go out at dusk are a fixed part of the city's evening."
    Market square: "in the square" — stated only at town — silent at hamlet, village, city, metropolis   [the `Civic announcements` service]
        the data says: "Official proclamations, wanted notices, and public notices read in the square."
    Parish burial grounds: "beyond the gate" — stated only at town — silent at hamlet, village, city, metropolis   [the catalog row]
        the data says: "Each parish keeps its own ground beside its church, and a parish that has filled its ground buries beyond the gate instead."
  ⛔ A FACE DRAWS ON EVERY TOWN OF THE PREIMAGE, so a placement the data states only at the city is an INVENTION on the thorp (floor 2), and a hedged one is a tendency rather than this town's fact.

(2d) THE KEY'S SIBLING RUNGS — what this pool's key would have been had ONE of the fields it fixes been otherwise
    monsterThreat = "plagued" HERE
        monsterThreat = "heartland" -> `Beasts & Monsters: settled, defenses beyond the need`
        monsterThreat = "frontier" -> `Beasts & Monsters: frontier, credible deterrence`
    force = true HERE
        force = false -> `Beasts & Monsters: plagued, perimeter but NO force to hold it`
  ⛔ A FACE THAT READS AS A NEIGHBOURING RUNG IS A FLOOR-1 FINDING (ADDENDUM 18 ruling 35). These pools have their OWN faces and their own towns: a sentence here that would sit as comfortably on one of them is either saying nothing this key fixes, or is saying something this key fixes is FALSE. The refuter names the rung.

## (7) THE SPEAKER ROSTER

⛔⛔ **READ THIS FIRST. THE PREIMAGE IS FIVE TIERS — hamlet 35/128 · village 40/128 · town 26/128 · city 36/128 · metropolis 36/128 (173 towns) — and the key fixes only that SOME force stands, never WHICH.** `force` is `garrison OR militia` (card §1), and the catalogue seats a different body at every rung:

| tier | the wall row that can seat the key | the force row that can seat the key | its bucket | the watch |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **hamlet** | `Palisade or earthworks` (`institutionalCatalog.js:342`, `required:false`) — the tier's ONLY wall-class row | `Citizen militia` (`:335`) — the tier's ONLY force row | **militia** | ⛔ **NO WATCH ROW EXISTS** |
| **village** | `Palisade or earthworks` (`:874`) — the tier's only wall-class row | `Citizen militia` (`:867`, *"Organised community defense. Musters for raids and monster incursions."*) | **militia** | ⛔ **NO WATCH ROW EXISTS** |
| **town** | `Town walls` (`:1332`) or `Gates (if walled)` (`:1356`) | `Barracks` (`:1363`, *"Housing for guards or small garrison"*) — see the judgment below | **garrison** | `Town watch` **required: true** (`:1348`) |
| **city** | `City walls and gates` **required: true** (`:1910`) | `Garrison` **required: true** (`:1925`) + `Professional city watch` **required: true** (`:1918`) | **garrison** (both) | required |
| **metropolis** | `Massive walls and fortifications` (`:2347`) — the tier's only walls-bucket row | `Multiple garrisons` (`:2352`) | **garrison** | no required row |

⚠ **MARKER'S JUDGMENT, VETOABLE — AT TOWN THE FORCE IS A `Barracks`, NOT A MILITIA.** `Citizen militia` at town (`:1340`) carries `exclusiveGroup: 'civilianDefense'` and its own words are *"Present only when no professional watch exists"*; `Town watch` shares that group and is `required: true` at `baseChance: 1`. The contradiction table already rules the pairing a finding (**F1-26**). So the only town-tier row that can turn `force` true is the `Barracks`, and the town half of this preimage is a GARRISON half. Say "veto" and the militia returns as a town possibility; nothing else in the card moves.

⛔ **CONSEQUENCE — THERE IS NO BODY WORD THAT IS TRUE ACROSS THIS POOL.** "The garrison" is false on 75 of the 173 towns (no garrison row exists at hamlet or village at all — **F1-06**'s own cite, `institutionalCatalog.js:325`, `:837`). "The militia", "volunteers with day jobs", "they have other work" is false on the other 98. "The watch" is false on all 75 hamlets and villages (**F1-01**, and **V-23**: *any* watch as a body below town contradicts `hasWatch` false). The safe words are the class words the entailment law leaves open — **"the muster"** (F1-03: *"'The muster' as the class word is free everywhere"*), **"the town's force"**, **"those under arms"**, **"whoever stands"**, **"the community"** — and, unusually for this block, **"the guard"**: `hasMilitaryInst` is TRUE on every town of this preimage (`priorityHelpers.js:45` matches `militia` at hamlet/village and `barracks`/`garrison` at town-plus), so **F1-04**'s licence applies and the word is the engine's own (`safetyProfile.js:271`, `:336`). ⛔ **But a muster ROLL cited is F1-24 on 98 towns** — the `muster` kind's only holder is `Citizen militia` (`holderTable.js:279-288`), which town, city and metropolis do not carry.

### UNIVERSAL — seated on every town this pool can draw

| speaker | what seats it at ALL FIVE tiers | its interest, from the town's own fields |
|---|---|---|
| **those under arms · the muster · the town's force** | ⭐ **THE KEY ITSELF.** `force = true` guarantees a live `garrison` or `militia` row (card §1; `standingDefenseForces`, `defenseInstitutionBuckets.js:169`). This is the speaker the sibling `NO force` pool does not have, and it is the pool's centre. | the purse. `milUpkeepMult = min(1, 0.6 + econOutput/50 × 0.4)` (`defenseGenerator.js:182`, `:189-192`) pays the wall and the wages out of ONE gate, and `defenseProfile.economicGates.military` prints beside the prose as *"Upkeep underfunded: {expense} at {n}%"* (`defenseDisplay.js:320`). Its grievance is a wage, never a headcount. ⚠ **V-09:** no wage, pay or arrears may be predicated of a `Citizen militia` — its row's own words are *"Part-time service"* and the hamlet/village rows carry no pay at all — so the pay grievance is a TOWN-PLUS speaker's and the militia tiers must voice their cost some other way (the drill, the day lost, the hands the fields do not get back). |
| **whoever holds the way through** | ⚠ **marker's judgment, derived and low-risk.** Card §5 prints `gates OPEN`, but `hasGates` matches `['gates','town walls','city walls','massive walls','palisade']` (`priorityHelpers.js:53`) and EVERY native wall row that can seat this key matches it: `Palisade or earthworks` (hamlet, village), `Town walls` / `Gates (if walled)` (town), `City walls and gates` (city, required), `Massive walls and fortifications` (metropolis, the tier's only walls-bucket row). A `Citadel` alone would not — and a city carries `City walls and gates` as a required row regardless. A CUSTOM wall row is invisible to `nativeSemanticName` and cannot seat the key at all. **No counterexample exists on the shipped catalogue.** | the one place on the perimeter where the wall is a thing somebody *does*, and on this key the one place the wall and the force meet. **Say "whoever holds the way through" / "whoever drops the bar", never "the gatekeeper" as a seated office.** |
| **whoever buries the dead** | ⭐ **THE ONLY REQUIRED-ROW-BACKED UNIVERSAL SPEAKER:** `Burial ground` (hamlet) · `Graveyard` (village) · `Parish burial grounds` (town) · `Burial grounds and charnel house` (city) · `Cemetery network` (metropolis) — `Burial` at p 1 on all five (card §2b). | what a `plagued` country actually costs, counted in graves and never in a number. ⚠ **THE FIVE ROWS ARE FIVE DIFFERENT SPEAKERS.** At hamlet the ground is *"kept by the households in turn"* and the placement *"at the edge"* is stated only there; at town *"beyond the gate"* is stated only there; at city *"inside the walls"* / *"outside the gates"* only there; and at metropolis (`institutionalCatalog.js:2392`) *"Burial has left the walls entirely… the parish registers are copied into a central roll"* — a placement and a record stated **only at metropolis**. Card §2c lists the first four; the metropolis row is the marker's addition, same ground. **Never place the ground; name the act.** |
| **the townsfolk / the households** | `Dwellings` (hamlet, village) · `Housing` (town, city), all required; population prints on the identity strip at every tier | they live behind the line and they are the unpaid half of the force — `communityMilBase` is exempt from the pay gate entirely (`defenseGenerator.js:186-192`). The `[public]` candidate's home. |
| **a stranger / a traveller** | no row needed (the brief's always-safe source) | what is visible on arrival: a kept perimeter, people on it, and a country the engine calls `plagued`. The only source that can report what the town has stopped noticing about its own posture. |

### CONDITIONAL — the field that seats each

| speaker | seated where | its interest |
|---|---|---|
| **the hall** (say "the hall" or "a clerk in the hall" — **never "the mayor", never "the clerk"**) | `Town hall` (town, required) · `City hall` (city, required). ⛔ **NOT at hamlet, village or metropolis** — below town the governing body is an elder or household consensus and **never a room** (**F1-20**; `institutionServices.js:1448-1453`), and metropolis has no required hall row. | the one purse, and its legitimacy. ⚠ the same row seats `hasCourtSystem` (`priorityHelpers.js:55`), so at town and city **the hall and the court are one row** — never contrast them as two bodies. |
| **the town's watch** | `Town watch` (town, required) · `Professional city watch` (city, required). **Nowhere else.** | ⛔ **F1-27:** a `Town watch` is *"Part-time guards. Night patrol and gate duty."* — never professional, never full-time, never soldiers. The professional rung is the separate CITY row. **F4-19:** the military pay gate DOES reach the watch (`fieldSynonyms.js:51`), so the watch shares the force's grievance and does not have a purse of its own. |
| **the guilds** | `Craft guilds (5-15)` (town, required). **Not required at city or metropolis, not present below town.** | the trades carry what the perimeter and the wages cost and get a certification service back. |
| **the tavern** | `Taverns (5-20)` (town) · `Inns and taverns (district)` (city) | the safety label and who actually turns out after dark. `economicState.safetyProfile.safetyLabel` is FROZEN and prints on the same page. |
| **the register / the sexton / a local priest** | `Access to parish church` (hamlet — ⚠ *"Walk 2-5km to village church"*, **F1-11**: the church is NOT in the settlement) · `Parish church` + `Priest (resident)` (village) · `Parish churches (2-5)` (town) · `Parish churches (10-30)` (city). **⛔ OPEN at metropolis** — the tier requires only the `Cemetery network`. | what the country takes and who is spoken over. At metropolis the record that survives is the `Central register` (p 0.9) on the cemetery row, not a parish. |
| **the elders** (plural, always) | the brief's below-town source: hamlet and village only | who has always gone out, and on whose word. **F1-22:** the elders resolve to `Household elder · Village elder · Village headman` (`holderTable.js:332-336`) — a family of speakers, never a seated body. |
| **the market / the stallholders** | `Market square` + `Weekly market` (town) · `Multiple market squares` + `Daily markets` (city). ⚠ *"read in the square"* is stated **only at town** (card §2c). | what comes in through the bar and is counted. |
| **the granary** | `Town granary` (town) · `City granaries` (city). **⛔ F1-09: no granary row exists below town.** | what is behind the line and worth taking. |

### NOT A SPEAKER ANYWHERE ON THIS POOL

- **the crown's assessor** — no typed producer; not a speaker (brief).
- **a mercenary company · a charter hall · a prison · a hospital · a warehouse** — all OPEN across the preimage (card §5). No baked body word, **in either direction** (F1-25). ⚠ the charter hall is the sharpest of these: `threatAssessment.js:54` prints either *"Charter hall coordinates specialist monster response"* or *"No specialist monster hunters on retainer"* beside the prose, so a face that asserts either is wrong on half the pool.
- **a `compromised` candidate** — card §2c records that this pool is **NOT** one of the pools a captured hall, watch or court is marked on. Under ruling 26 the tag is refused here; **offer none.**

### THE NAMED OFFICES A SPEAKER MUST NEVER BE
`npcGenerator.js:1511-1537` over all five preimage tiers — the union is wide:
- **hamlet:** `Elder`, `Parish Priest` · **village:** `Mayor`, `Guard Captain` · **town:** `Mayor`, `Guard Captain`, `High Priest` · **city:** + `Wealthiest Merchant` · **metropolis:** `Governor`, **`City Watch Chief`** (not a Guard Captain — §V.0 floor 3), `High Priest`, `Guild Archmage`, `Wealthiest Merchant`.
- ⛔ **A GUARD CAPTAIN IS MINTED FROM VILLAGE UPWARD** — on the village half he commands a `Citizen militia`, and he is a person on the next tab with a personality, a disposition and a secret. **Never predicate an act of a singular commander, headman, priest, mayor or watch chief.**
- `config.stressType` / `config.stressTypes` are in the same-page read set and OPEN, so `STRESS_MANDATORY_ROLES` can add `Garrison Commander` + `Retired Adventurer` (`monster_pressure`), `Healer` + `Parish Priest` (`plague_onset`), `Moneylender` (`indebted`), `Chief Magistrate` and the rest. **Keep every acting person plural, anonymous, or a trade.**

## (8) WHAT WOULD BE FALSE

The rows of `recut/CONTRADICTION-TABLE.md` this key can actually walk into, each with its field. ⛔ **THE POOL'S CHARACTERISTIC FAILURE IS NOT AN ABSENCE INFERRED INTO A SILENCE — IT IS A BODY WORD BAKED ONTO A FIVE-TIER PREIMAGE.** The key fixes THAT a force stands and never WHICH, so **F1-02** (a garrison as the town's own body, `priorityHelpers.js:46`) is false on all 75 hamlets and villages, where no garrison row exists in the catalogue at all (`institutionalCatalog.js:325`, `:837`), and **F1-03** (a militia as a standing body) is false on the 98 towns, cities and metropolises, where `Citizen militia` is excluded at town by `exclusiveGroup: 'civilianDefense'` against the required `Town watch` (**F1-26**, `:1340-1354`) and does not exist above it — with **F1-24** on top for a muster *roll* cited on any of those 98, the `muster` kind's only holder being `Citizen militia` (`holderTable.js:279-288`), which makes **the safe form the class word and never the record**; from there — **F1-01 / V-23** the watch as a body on the 75 hamlets and villages, where no watch row exists and `hasWatch` is false; **F1-27** the town's watch called professional, full-time or soldiers against a row reading *"Part-time guards"* (`:1348`), and its mirror, a CITY watch called part-time against *"Full-time law enforcement"* (`:1918`); **F1-29 as §V.2 corrects it** — "the garrison relieves the watch" is TWO required rows at city and therefore lawful there, and refused at town, so on a pool spanning both **the contrast is refused pool-wide**; **F1-31 / V-03** any tier word or scale word, which on a preimage running hamlet→metropolis means *every* one is wrong somewhere ("a place this size", "everyone here knows everyone", "the quarters", "the districts", "the lanes of the city" all fail on one half or the other; `OverviewTab.jsx:247` prints the tier verbatim); **V-06 / F1-32** a baked wall MATERIAL — this preimage pools `Palisade or earthworks` (*timber or earth*) at hamlet and village against `Town walls` (*stone*), `City walls and gates` (*masonry*) and `Massive walls and fortifications` (which fixes NONE), so **"the stone ring" is false on 75 towns and "the stakes" on 98**, and since this pool **IS** in `WALLED_DEF2_POOLS` (`defenseStateProse.js:506`, computed from the key readers) the `{defmaterial}` slot is the only lawful way to name it — it renders `undefined` on a metropolis and the kernel then DROPS that variant (`:1122-1133`), which is the designed behaviour; **F1-33** a material SOURCE (*"cut from its own woods"*, *"the stone of the country"*) where a fortification supply chain runs (`supplyChainData.js:873-884`); **F1-07 and F1-08 inverted** — denying the perimeter or denying a gate, both fixed the other way by the key and by `hasGates` on every native wall row that can seat it; **F1-20** a hall, chamber or council room as a PLACE on the hamlet and village halves, where the governing body is a consensus and not a room, and equally at metropolis, which requires no hall row; **F1-09 / F1-10 / F1-11** a granary, a standing market or a church *building* asserted below town, or a parish assumed at metropolis where only the `Cemetery network` is required, or a church "in the settlement" at hamlet where the row's own words are *"Walk 2-5km to village church"*; ⛔ **THE SIBLING-SENTENCE TRAP, WHICH IS THIS POOL'S OWN AND HAS NO ID — THE ENGINE SAYS THE POSTURE WORKS.** `threatAssessment.js:54` prints *"Walls and garrison have established a survivable posture"* on the garrison half and `:59` prints *"a viable but demanding posture"* on the militia half, and `:115` / `:117` say *"meaningful deterrence"* / *"credible deterrence against raiders"* — so a face asserting the town is losing, overrun, breaking, cannot hold, or that the arrangement has failed **contradicts a machine sentence printed beside it** (floor 1, the §V.0 same-page-read-set quantifier); and the mirror is equally barred, because `:59` says *"Watch rotations are thin. Simultaneous incursions will break coverage"* and `:117` *"inadequate against any professional force with siege capability"*, so a face asserting the town is secure, equal to it, or no longer at risk is false on the militia half — **the lawful register is exactly the shipped row 3's: it holds, and holding costs**; **F4-05** `plagued` read as DISEASE when it is MONSTERS (`monsterThreat.js:28`; `SummaryTab.jsx:28`, `:37`), compounded here because `safetyProfile.js:276` can print *"the constant monster threat keeps the guard exceptionally well-drilled and alert"* beside the prose, so a slack, cowed or unpractised force contradicts a sibling branch; ⛔ **F4-02 / V-17 THE TWO PURSES** — *"the wall is kept and the men are not paid"*, *"spent on repair rather than on holding"*, *"the wall pays for itself"* are all false against ONE multiplier covering *"garrison wages, wall maintenance"* together (`defenseGenerator.js:182`, `:189-192`); the engine's asymmetry is in the CONSEQUENCE (*a built wall keeps standing, unpaid soldiers desert slowly*, `:184-187`), never in the pay; **F4-03** splitting the direction of the four gates (military 0.6 · monster 0.7 · internal 0.65 · disaster 0.55, all on ONE input — they differ in degree, never in direction); **F4-04** a total collapse of pay, where the licensed extreme is short, late or thin and never none, and a headcount of the drift is **F2-01**; **V-09** any wage, pay or arrears predicated of a `Citizen militia` — which reaches the whole hamlet and village half of this pool, so **the militia tiers' cost must be voiced as the day lost and never as the coin owed**; **F4-19** denying that the pay gate reaches the watch, which it does; **F4-01 / §V.0 floor 4** a decay clock on the fabric (rot, weathering, erosion, *"the timber is going"*) **and equally any permanence** (*"the wall will outlast the town"*), since calamity, razing and the purse's own economic-distress closure all remove fabric and `institutionLifecycle.js:792-848` reaches `Palisade or earthworks` and `Town walls` by name (only `City walls and gates` is exempt); **F4-06** explaining the readiness band by the works (`defenseGenerator.js:510`); **F4-07** the river or the coast doing nothing for the defence; **F4-13 / the audience contract** — no covert fact on a player face, and **no `compromised` candidate is offered on this pool at all** (card §2c); **F2-05 / V-04 THE ELAPSED COURSE, READ PRECISELY HERE** — ruling 11b licenses the perfect and the durative over **the key's own reads** (the `walls`, `garrison` and `militia` buckets) and over every FROZEN field the card's §6 prints, of which `config.monsterThreat` is the one that matters most (**zero writers**, so *"the country has always been thick with them"* is LAWFUL), together with `defenseProfile.economicGates.military`, `economicState.safetyProfile.*` and `defenseProfile.scores.{military,internal,economic,monster}` — **but `institutions[bucket=watch]`, `[bucket=charter]`, `[bucket=mercenary]` and the root `institutions` are LIVE at 38 writers and are NOT reads of this key**, so *"the watch has kept the gate since…"*, *"the charter hall has always answered"* are floor 2, and a thinning force is a STANDING STATE at most (*"posts stand unfilled"*, *"the muster is thin"*) and never a course (*"thinner than it was"*); **F2-06** a RATE, which the **shipped row 1 breaches verbatim** (*"both are in use constantly"*) and **shipped row 2** twice over (*"the rotations run, the gates close on time"* asserts a frequency and a punctuality nothing bands); **F2-01** any magnitude in a digit or a word — a headcount of the force, a share of the town under arms, how many stand a night; **F2-02** any date or duration; **F2-03 / F2-09** a raising, a founding or any age-flavour, since **no read of this key is a history field** and a reroll of history desyncs it (`historyPreservation.js:1-30`) — ⚠ and the pool's own doc note warns against *historical* walls (walls built after a siege) unless the history surface supplies the ancestry; **F2-04** an event the record did not run; **F2-08** a trend (*"it has grown"*, *"worse than last season"*); **F3-05** cultural furniture the eleven profiles deny — thatch, hearth-smoke, the churchyard, the market green, snow on the road (each profile carries a printed `defensePattern` that no defense pool reads, so this row is STRONGER on a defense block, not weaker); **F3-06** an unnamed person acting on a singular office the tier names — and on this preimage that list is the union `Elder · Parish Priest · Mayor · Guard Captain · High Priest · Wealthiest Merchant · Governor · City Watch Chief · Guild Archmage`, plus every stress role; **F1-102 / V-08** the approach or terrain named against `config.terrainType` / `tradeRouteAccess`, both printed on the overview; **F1-126** a minted proper name borne by the face — a person, a gate, a lane, a company; **F1-34 / F1-35 / F1-36 / F1-40** an engine label read at its English sense, or the readiness badge outrun, ⚠ with **§1.4 W-10** standing over all of it (the key is BOOLEAN and the badge is CONTINUOUS, computed from different inputs, so no intensity word is refutable off the badge); **V-16** if `occupied` is the stress, the town's own force stands diminished (×0.40, −35), never removed; ruling 12, **{settlement} in at most one unit of the pool and never in a `[face]` sub-row** — ⚠ all three shipped rows carry it today; and finally ⛔ **THE CITATION CEILING, WHICH ON THIS POOL IS ZERO** — the three shipped rows of `Beasts & Monsters: plagued, perimeter AND organized force` carry **no named record of any kind**, so under F1-24 and the never-spend-a-citation rule **no face here may cite a muster roll, a toll book, the register, the accounts, the parish books or "from the road"**; every account is attributed by ROLE and nothing else. ⚠ **AND THE COLLISIONS THAT ARE NOT FINDINGS:** §1.4 **W-09** — `threatAssessment.js:59` hardcodes *"Palisade and citizen militia"* on a branch that fires for ANY walls row, so at village it may say palisade over an earthwork bank and its militia word is the engine's own; under the §1.4 tie-break **the ROSTER is the record, the face that agrees with the roster stands, and the collision is a wiring row** — and the same applies to every snapshot sibling in card §4, since this key reads the LIVE roster (`standingDefenseForces`) while the machine strings read the generation-time snapshot; **W-08** the `Town watch`'s `Gate duty` against `safetyProfile.js:463-464`'s *"no gates to bribe"* (follow the services panel); **W-10** as above.

## (9) WHERE THE FLAVOUR IS

**WHAT IS IN USE — the only pool of this row where the wall and the people who hold it are both facts.** Every sibling `Beasts & Monsters` pool is an absence of one or the other; this one is an arrangement that actually runs, in a country the engine calls thick with creatures. The concrete things it puts in front of a speaker are all *maintenance of a working posture*: the bar dropped at the same point every night by whoever is nearest to it, the stair to the walk worn where feet go up and not where stores are stacked, the ground outside kept clear because someone decided long ago that it would be, the drill that takes hands out of the fields on the militia half and takes a wage out of the one purse on the garrison half, the gate that people arrive at and are looked over before they come through. **The pool's own texture is ORDINARINESS UNDER PRESSURE** — the shipped row 2 has it exactly right in substance (*it is the week's work, and nobody treats any of it as unusual*) and wrong in law (a rate and a punctuality nothing bands). Write the habitual present and let the strangeness sit in what the town has stopped finding strange.

**WHAT IS IN DISPUTE — not whether it works, but what it costs and who pays.** The engine will not let anyone say the posture is failing; it says *survivable*, *viable but demanding*, *credible deterrence*. So the disagreement is never about the outcome and always about the bill. One purse pays the wall and the wages together, and the people who pay into it are not the people who stand: at town and city the hall holds the accounts and the trades and the guilds fund them, while the force's case is a wage; at hamlet and village there is no hall, no purse to argue with and no wage to be owed — the cost is a day a household does not get back, and the argument is between neighbours about whose turn it was. **That split is the pool's best pair material, and it runs the opposite way at the two halves of the preimage.** Two sources can read the same kept wall as thrift and as a debt, and the record settles neither.

**WHAT THE ABSENCE LOOKS LIKE ON THE GROUND — this pool's absence is not of a body but of a MARGIN.** Everything is seated and everything is thin: the engine's own sentence on the militia half says the rotations are thin and **simultaneous** incursions break coverage, and on the garrison half that the posture is *not rated for sustained siege*. So the hook is what the arrangement cannot absorb — a second thing on the same night, a gate that must stay open one hour longer than usual, a person who is on the wall and therefore not somewhere else. Nothing here is broken and nothing here is spare, and the DM notebook's proper subject is the question the fair copy cannot settle: what the town does the night the country asks for two things at once.
