  ⛔ A SERVICE AT OR ABOVE THE BAR IS A THING THE TOWN'S OWN MODEL SAYS THIS BODY DOES: denying it is floor 1, whatever the face is otherwise about. A row filed under `standing` is UNDER ARMS in the engine's reading even where the key fixes no garrison and no militia.

  ⛔ AN OBSERVATION AND A PUBLIC FACE ARE FACTS THEIR SPEAKER CLAIMS (rulings 27 (a), 28 (a)), so neither may INFER INTO A SILENCE a required row denies. On a preimage carrying a `Town watch`, "no member of the watch has walked the wall" is floor 1 in a witness's coat; "no soldier has been seen on the wall" is true on every town that draws a key fixing no garrison and no militia. The PUBLIC's second half — what everyone MAKES of what it saw — is a perception and may be mistaken; the seeing may not.
  ⛔ AND THE FAIR COPY DOES NOT CITE ITSELF (ADDENDUM 18 ruling 40, the owner's): an observation is a BARE PASSIVE with no observer named — never "in the survey's time here", "on the nights the survey kept", "it is observed that", "this office".

(2c) COVERT FIELDS AND THEIR SYMPTOMS ON THIS BLOCK (ADDENDUM 18 ruling 26) — the INVERTED test the refuter judges a `compromised` face under
    hall ← powerStructure.criminalCaptureState at `corrupted` or `capture`
        SYMPTOM: THE PURSE AND THE ACCOUNTS — what the hall says the town's money does, and who decides it. DS-DEF-4 says the fact outright ("the hall's decisions are not the hall's"), so a hall face on a purse pool may reassure that the accounts are in order and may deny NOTHING ELSE.
        marks the pools: Invasion & War: walls with NO force · Economic Survival: STRONG · Economic Survival: ADEQUATE · Economic Survival: WEAK
        this pool is NOT one of them — here the source draws as any source
    watch ← a bloc carrying `covert: true` (settlementPolitics)
        SYMPTOM: THE WATCH'S OWN KEEPING — the circuit, the wage, who is on the walk after dark. A watch face on an internal-security pool may say the patrol is kept as it has always been kept, and may deny nothing about the court, the purse or the walls.
        marks the pools: Internal Security: full legal chain (court AND prison) · Internal Security: detention without process · Internal Security: no legal infrastructure
        this pool is NOT one of them — here the source draws as any source
    court ← a bloc carrying `covert: true` (settlementPolitics)
        SYMPTOM: WHAT REACHES THE LAW AND WHAT IT DOES WITH IT — a court face on a legal-chain pool may hold that matters are heard as they should be, and may deny nothing else.
        marks the pools: Internal Security: full legal chain (court AND prison) · Internal Security: court without detention
        this pool is NOT one of them — here the source draws as any source
  ⛔ THE INVERTED TEST. A face tagged `compromised` is the ONE place the reassurance tell is the point (ruling 26 (a)), and FLOOR 1 IS RE-POINTED FOR IT ALONE (26 (b)): it may deny the VISIBLE SYMPTOM of the very field it is compromised by, in the direction of CONCEALMENT ONLY. It never denies an unrelated field, never a required row, and never names the covert fact. The archiver reports it as flatly as any account: no wink.
  ⛔ THE CONCEALMENT MUST NOT IDENTIFY (26 (f)): offer more than one shape — dismiss · reassure · minimise · change the subject · blame the source of the talk · say nothing beyond the form. An HONEST source may also reassure truthfully on a small share of honest towns, so a reassurance on the page is a question and never an answer.
  ⛔ AND THE SOURCE IS SILENT SOME OF THE TIME (26 (h)): where a compromised source is present on a marked pool, a roll seeded on the world seed, the pool key, the settlement and the CURRENT YEAR decides whether it speaks (0.7) or says nothing. Its silence is a behaviour, and the roll decides WHO SPEAKS and never WHAT IS TRUE.
  ⛔ THE TAG IS REFUSED on any source no covert field can compromise; the table is CLOSED: hall · watch · court.

  PLACEMENTS A FACE MAY NOT ASSERT — where a body STANDS, stated by the data at some preimage tiers and not others, or stated with a hedge
    Burial grounds and charnel house: "inside the walls" — stated only at city — silent at town, metropolis   [the catalog row]
        the data says: "The parish grounds inside the walls filled generations ago, so the dead are lifted once their term is up and their bones stacked in the charnel house to make room for the next."
    Burial grounds and charnel house: "outside the gates" — stated only at city — silent at town, metropolis   [the catalog row · the `Burial` service]
        the data says: "New ground has been bought outside the gates, and the carts that go out at dusk are a fixed part of the city's evening."
    Market square: "in the square" — stated only at town — silent at city, metropolis   [the `Civic announcements` service]
        the data says: "Official proclamations, wanted notices, and public notices read in the square."
    Parish burial grounds: "beyond the gate" — stated only at town — silent at city, metropolis   [the catalog row]
        the data says: "Each parish keeps its own ground beside its church, and a parish that has filled its ground buries beyond the gate instead."
  ⛔ A FACE DRAWS ON EVERY TOWN OF THE PREIMAGE, so a placement the data states only at the city is an INVENTION on the thorp (floor 2), and a hedged one is a tendency rather than this town's fact.

(2d) THE KEY'S SIBLING RUNGS — what this pool's key would have been had ONE of the fields it fixes been otherwise
    granary = true HERE
        granary = false -> `Disasters & Famine: NO reserves, hospital present`
    hospital = true HERE
        hospital = false -> `Disasters & Famine: granary AND parish care only`
  ⛔ A FACE THAT READS AS A NEIGHBOURING RUNG IS A FLOOR-1 FINDING (ADDENDUM 18 ruling 35). These pools have their OWN faces and their own towns: a sentence here that would sit as comfortably on one of them is either saying nothing this key fixes, or is saying something this key fixes is FALSE. The refuter names the rung.

================================================================================
THE MARKER'S SECTIONS (seat: opus). Sections (1)-(7-mechanical) above are
`node scripts/prose-mark-card.mjs DS-DEF-2 'Disasters & Famine: granary AND hospital'`
run read-only in the dock, pasted verbatim.
================================================================================

(0) ⛔ THE MARKER'S CORRECTION TO THE MACHINE SECTIONS — READ BEFORE (5) AND (7)

The instrument reads `institutionalCatalog.metropolis` as the metropolis's catalogue. The
generator does not. `assembleInstitutions.js:243-245`:

    const catalogForTier = tier === 'metropolis'
      ? mergeCatalogs(institutionalCatalog['city'] || {}, institutionalCatalog['metropolis'] || {})
      : institutionalCatalog[tier] || {};

and `mergeCatalogs` (`:117-124`) is a per-category shallow merge, so **every CITY row survives
into the metropolis unless a metropolis row of the same NAME overrides it.** Executed against
the file, exactly two names collide (`Daily markets`, `facets`), and the metropolis's own
`Daily markets` is `required: false, baseChance: 0` ("Superseded at metropolis scale") while
`Multiple market squares` is untouched. **Therefore thirteen city `required: true` rows are
required at metropolis as well:**

    Aqueduct or water system · Burial grounds and charnel house · City granaries · City hall ·
    City walls and gates · Garrison · Housing (1000-5000 structures) · Inns and taverns
    (district) · Multiple courthouses · Multiple market squares · Parish churches (10-30) ·
    Professional city watch · Warehouse district

Section (2)'s "metropolis (1): Cemetery network" is the metropolis BLOCK, not the metropolis
ROSTER. Section (5) is wrong in the same place, and the corrections all run one way — toward
MORE closed, not less:

  • **watch — CLOSED TRUE ON THE WHOLE PREIMAGE**, not "open at metropolis". `Town watch` is
    required at town, `Professional city watch` at city and (by the merge) metropolis. **This
    is the sitting's own named failure mode and it is live here**: "nobody is set up to
    respond", "no one is charged with any of it", "there is nobody to send" are floor 1 on
    every town this pool draws.
  • **garrison — required at city AND metropolis; OPEN at town only.** `Professional city
    watch` sits in the garrison bucket as well as the watch bucket
    (`defenseInstitutionBuckets.js:84-97`), and `Garrison` is a second, separate required row.
  • **walls and gates — required at city AND metropolis; OPEN at town only.**
  • **granary — required at all three** (`City granaries` survives the merge), which the key
    fixes anyway.
  • **market · hall · court · church — required at all three.**
  • genuinely OPEN across the preimage: **militia · mercenary · charter · prison.**

And one correction that runs the other way, against the brief's standing roster:

  • **THE GUILDS ARE NOT A UNIVERSAL SOURCE ON THIS POOL.** `Craft guilds (5-15)` is
    `required: true` at TOWN only. No guild row is required at city. At metropolis
    `Craft guilds (100-150+)` and `Merchant guilds (50-100+)` are `required: false`
    (baseChance 0.7 each). The brief seats the guilds at "town and above"; the catalogue seats
    them at town and nowhere else. They are CONDITIONAL here.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

(7) THE SPEAKERS

The preimage is **entirely town and above** — town 95/128, city 68/128, metropolis 109/128;
`silent tiers: thorp, hamlet, village`. So, unlike the below-town pools of this block, the
brief's institutional roster is mostly available. Two entries of it are not:

  • **THE ELDERS ARE NOT A SPEAKER.** The brief seats them "below town". This pool never draws
    below town. "The older households" as a source has no row here.
  • **THE GUILDS ARE CONDITIONAL** — see (0).
  • **THE MUSTER IS NOT A SPEAKER AND NOT A BODY AT TOWN.** `Citizen militia` carries
    `exclusiveGroup: 'civilianDefense'` and "Present only when no professional watch exists"
    (`institutionalCatalog.js:1340-1354`); `Town watch` shares the group and is REQUIRED at
    town. A militia and the required watch cannot both stand there [F1-26]. The militia bucket
    is OPEN across the preimage and fixed on no town of it.
  • **THE CROWN'S ASSESSOR IS NOT A SPEAKER** anywhere (no typed producer; the brief).

--- UNIVERSAL (a `required: true` row on every preimage tier seats them) ---

  1. THE HALL — `Town hall` (town) / `City hall` (city, metropolis).
     INTEREST: the purse and what it is asked to carry. One military purse runs the wall's
     keeping and the soldiers' wages together (`defenseGenerator.js:177-192`,
     `milUpkeepMult = min(1, 0.6 + econOutput/50 × 0.4)`), a second gate at 0.55 runs the
     disaster side (`:614`), and both are the same economic input. The hall is the body that
     decides which call on one purse is answered first, and its legitimacy is the thing it is
     defending when it answers.
     ⚠ Say "the hall" or "a clerk in the hall". **Never "the clerk", never "the mayor"** —
     `Mayor` (town, city) and `Governor` (metropolis) are minted NPCs.
     ⚠ **THE HALL KEEPS NO ARCHIVE AT THE BAR.** `Town hall`'s `Record filing` is
     `on: false, p 0.6`; `City hall`'s `Public record access` is `on: false, p 0.6`. See the
     F1-24 row in (8): the hall's accounts are not a citable record on this pool.

  2. THE TAVERN — `Taverns (5-20)` (town) / `Inns and taverns (district)` (city, metropolis).
     INTEREST: the safety label and who is actually short. `Information` / `Information hub`
     is `on: false` at both, so the tavern is a VIEW and never a source of intelligence the
     engine warrants — which is exactly the standing an unverifiable account should have.
     ⚠ Say "at the tavern they say". Plural rows at every tier; never one named house.

  3. THE PARISH, AND THOSE WHO BURY — `Parish churches (2-5)` + `Parish burial grounds`
     (town) · `Parish churches (10-30)` + `Burial grounds and charnel house` (city) · the same
     two plus `Cemetery network` (metropolis).
     INTEREST: the care nobody is paid for, and the count of what the town lost. This is the
     one body on the pool whose work rises exactly when the key's two states are tested.
     ⚠ **THE RECORD IS NOT UNIFORM ACROSS THE PREIMAGE.** `Register of the dead` is at the bar
     at TOWN (p 0.8, "The sexton records who lies where"); at CITY the charnel-house row's
     services are `Burial` and `Lifting and ossuary` and **no register at all**; at METROPOLIS
     `Central register` returns at p 0.9. So the sexton's book resolves on two tiers of three.
     See (8).
     ⚠ Say "the register", "the sexton", "a local priest". **Never "the priest", never "the
     parish priest", never "the high priest"** — `High Priest` is minted at all three tiers and
     `Parish Priest` under `plague_onset` and `religious_conversion`.

  4. THE WATCH — `Town watch` (town) / `Professional city watch` (city, metropolis). See (0):
     this is the correction, and it makes the watch a SAFE speaker on this pool where most of
     the block's pools cannot seat one.
     INTEREST: what a hungry or sick town does to a patrol. Its work is fixed and narrow at
     town — "Part-time guards. Night patrol and gate duty" (`institutionalCatalog.js:1348`),
     services `Night patrol` p 1.0 and `Gate duty` p 0.8 — and professional at city and above,
     services `Law enforcement` p 1.0 and `Crime reporting` p 0.8. It is paid out of both
     purses (F4-19; `fieldSynonyms.js:51`, `defenseGenerator.js:244-253`).
     ⚠ **F1-27:** never describe the watch as professional, full-time, or as soldiers — that
     is a CITY row's word on a town's roster. Write its WORK, which is identical at every tier.
     ⚠ **F1-29 as §V.2 corrects it:** at city and metropolis `Garrison` and `Professional city
     watch` are two distinct required rows and the contrast is true there; at town no garrison
     row is required at all. A face drawing across the preimage may not set the two against
     each other ("the garrison relieves the watch").
     ⚠ Never "the guard captain" (town, city) or "the city watch chief" (metropolis).

  5. THE MARKET — `Market square` + `Weekly market` (town) / `Multiple market squares` (city,
     metropolis).
     INTEREST: the price of bread and who takes a share of it. `Weekly market`'s
     `Tax collection` is at the bar at town, p 0.9 — "Toll collected on goods sold. A
     percentage to the lord or municipality." At city and metropolis the toll moves to the
     gate (`City walls and gates`, `Gate control` p 1.0, "Customs checks and toll collection").
     So the market is a speaker about what grain costs; WHO takes the cut is tier-dependent.
     ⚠ **F1-10:** the class admits `Black market`, `Slave market`, `Whisper market`. The
     required rows here are ordinary produce markets, so the word is safe — the DESCRIPTION of
     a particular market's trade is not.

  6. THE GRANARY'S KEEPERS — fixed by the key. `Town granary` (town, required) / `City
     granaries` (city, metropolis, required) / `State granary complex` (metropolis, 0.70).
     INTEREST: the stores are theirs to hold and not theirs to open. `City granaries` is
     "State managed"; the hall or the crown decides. This is the pool's own best disagreement.
     ⚠ **THE SECOND SERVICES ARE OFF.** See (8) — rationing, grain loans, price stabilisation
     and milling are all in the menu and all below the bar.

  7. WHOEVER TAKES THE SICK — fixed by the key, **and the body is not.** Six rows can seat it
     across the preimage: `Small hospital` or `Monastery or friary` (town), `Major hospital` or
     `Multiple monasteries` (city), `Hospital network` or `Major monasteries (5-10)`
     (metropolis).
     INTEREST: whichever it is, it is a religious institution by tag ("Usually religious-run")
     and it answers to something other than the hall. Its stake is that it is asked for more
     than it was founded to give.
     ⛔ **THIS IS THE CARD'S SHARPEST ROW. SEE (8).** The function is fixed; the building is
     not; naming either shape by its own word contradicts the other.
     ⚠ Never "the healer" — `Healer` is minted under `famine` and `plague_onset`, the two
     stresses this pool's subject invites most.

  8. THE STRANGER — seated by the brief on every town, needing no row.
     INTEREST: arrives at a town that is arranged against both of the things it is arranged
     against, and sees the arrangement before the town does. At city and metropolis they arrive
     through a required gate and are counted at it. ⚠ their eye is bounded by (2b′): they may
     report only what could be SEEN.

--- CONDITIONAL (the field that seats each, and where it does not) ---

  THE GUILDS — `Craft guilds (5-15)` required at TOWN; nothing required at city;
    `Craft guilds (100-150+)` 0.70 / `Merchant guilds (50-100+)` 0.70 at metropolis.
    INTEREST: the trades want the market fed and the toll lower. `Quality certification` p 1.0
    and `Apprenticeship programs` p 0.8 are at the bar; `Trade regulation` and `Dispute
    resolution` are not. ⚠ Never "the guild master" (minted under famine, mass_migration,
    wartime). ⚠ Never lean on the plural ("the guilds, all of them") — ruling 25.
  WHOEVER HOLDS THE WAY THROUGH — `City walls and gates` required at city and metropolis,
    OPEN at town. `Gate control` p 1.0 carries the customs check and the toll.
    INTEREST: what comes in and what it is worth to let it in. Conditional; do not seat a gate
    on a town-tier face.
  THE GARRISON — required at city and metropolis, OPEN at town. Services `Defence services`
    p 1.0, `Mercenary hire` p 0.6, `Equipment purchase` p 0.7.
    INTEREST: paid from the same purse as the wall's keeping [F4-02].
  THE MILLERS — `Mills (2-5)` required at TOWN only ("Grain grinding" p 1.0). Not a required
    row at city or metropolis. The grain's choke point is a town-tier fact here.
  THE WAREHOUSES — `Warehouse district` required at city and metropolis only, `Goods storage`
    p 1.0. Note it is NOT a granary and does not fire `hasGranary` [F1-19, F1-09].
  THE PRISON — no prison row required at any preimage tier; `Massive prison` at metropolis is
    `required: false`. The bucket is OPEN.
  THE MERCENARIES AND THE CHARTER — OPEN everywhere; never asserted, never denied [F1-05,
    F1-06, F1-25].

--- THE NAMED OFFICES A SPEAKER MUST NEVER BE (`npcGenerator.js:1511-1537`, F3-06) ---

  town:        **Mayor · Guard Captain · High Priest**
  city:        **Mayor · Guard Captain · High Priest · Wealthiest Merchant**
  metropolis:  **Governor · City Watch Chief · High Priest · Guild Archmage ·
                Wealthiest Merchant**
  and by stress, on any tier: famine → **Healer · Guild Master** · plague_onset → **Healer ·
  Parish Priest** · indebted → **Moneylender** · under_siege / wartime / monster_pressure /
  slave_revolt → **Garrison Commander**, **Guard Captain** · occupied / insurgency → **Corrupt
  Official** · recently_betrayed / succession_void → **Chief Magistrate** ·
  politically_fractured / religious_conversion / succession_void → **Council Member** ·
  mass_migration → **Guild Master · Healer** · monster_pressure → **Retired Adventurer**.

  ⛔ SO, ON THIS POOL: never the mayor, the governor, the guard captain, the city watch chief,
  the high priest, the parish priest, the wealthiest merchant, the guild archmage, the guild
  master, **the healer**, the moneylender, the chief magistrate, the garrison commander. Each
  is one generated person on the next tab with a personality, a disposition and a secret.
  The plural, the trade and the ground are all free: a clerk in the hall · whoever keeps the
  granary door · those who take the sick in · the bearers · a carter · the night patrol.

--- THE SEAM THE WRITERS MUST KNOW ABOUT ---

  ⚠ **A FAMINE OR PLAGUE-ONSET TOWN MINTS A HEALER** on the NPC tab while this key already
  says the town has somewhere to take the sick. The two are not in conflict — but a face
  reaching for "the one person here who knows medicine" collides with a generated person on the
  same dossier, and it is the wrong shape anyway: this pool's provision is an INSTITUTION.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

(8) WHAT WOULD BE FALSE

The key fixes two flags and nothing else, and the two behave in opposite directions, which is
the whole difficulty of this card. `hasGranary` matches the bare substring `granar`
(`priorityHelpers.js:63`), so on this preimage it always seats an actual grain store — `Town
granary`, `City granaries` or `State granary complex` — and the granary building is genuinely
yours. `hasHospital` matches `hospital · monastery · healer · friary` (`:64`), so it seats one
of six quite different rows, and **the building is not fixed at all**: at town either a `Small
hospital` ("Care for sick poor. Usually religious-run") or a `Monastery or friary` ("Religious
community. **May** operate hospital/school"), at city either a `Major hospital` ("50-100 beds")
or `Multiple monasteries` ("Different religious orders"), at metropolis either a `Hospital
network` or `Major monasteries (5-10)`. The village-tier `Healer (divine, 1st level)` — the
PERSON that F1-14 is usually about — is a village row and village is a silent tier, so a
building of some kind always stands; **which** building does not, and that is the finding. "The
hospital", "the infirmary", "the ward", "the beds", "the sick-house", "the physicians"
contradicts a printed `Monastery or friary` row, whose own `Herbalism and healing` service is
`on: false, p 0.5` and therefore **below the bar** — the engine does not turn healing on there
at all; and "the monastery", "the brothers", "the order", "the cloister" contradicts a printed
`Small hospital`. This is V-06's pooled-key logic exactly ("the stone ring" on a palisade
town): write the FUNCTION and let the fill name the row [F1-14, V-06, F1-30]. And note the
`Monastery or friary` menu is where the town's real particulars are — `Hospitality` p 0.8 (food
and shelter for travellers, often free), `Copyist services` p 0.7 — none of which is medicine.
The machine sentences run the other way and are just as binding, because all three **fire on
every preimage town**: `threatAssessment.js:181` prints "Granary provides food buffer. The
community can absorb a bad harvest without immediate hardship." and " Hospital infrastructure
enables disease containment and systematic quarantine."; `defenseDisplay.js:237`, `:239`,
`:243` print "Hospital present", "Casualty treatment, outbreak containment, recovery capacity."
and "Granary present". So no face may say the sick have nowhere to go, that an outbreak cannot
be held, that there is no recovery in the place, that quarantine is beyond the town, that
nothing is put by, that the stores are empty, or that a bad harvest bites the same season —
every one of those is the negation direction against a sentence printed inches away [F1-25,
F1-107]. Equally, the granary's SECOND services are all below the bar and may not be asserted:
`Town granary`'s `Milling service` off p 0.5, `City granaries`' **`Rationing` off p 0.6**
("Controlled distribution in times of shortage. Prevents hoarding") and **`Grain loans` off
p 0.4** ("Advance grain to farmers against next harvest"), `State granary complex`'s `Price
stabilisation` off p 0.5 — so no face may say the grain is rationed, that distribution is
controlled, that hoarding is prevented, that seed is advanced against a coming harvest, that
stored grain is released to hold prices down, or that the granary grinds [F1-30]. The
neighbouring rungs bind next and are easy to drift into (2d, ruling 35): `granary = false` is
`NO reserves, hospital present` and `hospital = false` is `granary AND parish care only` — so
a face whose medical provision is the CLERGY ("clergy tend the sick", "prayer and nursing",
"better than nothing and short of a hospital") is writing the sibling rung's own sentence, and
the sibling's machine string ("Parish clergy provide basic wound care") is precisely the branch
that CANNOT fire here, since `hasHospital` takes the first arm [F1-25, ruling 35]. The parish
is required at every preimage tier and is a fine speaker; it is not this pool's answer to
disease. The record bar is the next hard row and it closes tighter than it looks: **no cited
record resolves on all three preimage tiers**, so no face may name a book. `Register of the
dead` is at the bar at town (p 0.8, "The sexton records who lies where") and at metropolis as
`Central register` (p 0.9) but **is absent at city**, where `Burial grounds and charnel house`
carries only `Burial` and `Lifting and ossuary`; the hall's archive is below the bar at every
tier (`Record filing` off p 0.6 at town, `Public record access` off p 0.6 at city); the watch
records crimes at city and metropolis (`Crime reporting` p 0.8) and **not at town**, where
`Crime response` is off p 0.7; the parish's own `Record keeping` is off p 0.6 at town and
absent at city. The toll is at the market at town (`Tax collection` p 0.9) and at the gate at
city and metropolis (`Gate control` p 1.0), and the gate is not fixed at town at all. So the
accounts, the register, the parish rolls, the toll book and the muster roll each fail F1-24 on
at least one tier this face will draw on, and "the books" as a generic is barred outright
[F1-24 / §R-8, V-01]. The four rosters then bite as SILENCES, corrected as (0) corrects them:
the watch is CLOSED TRUE everywhere, so "nobody is set up to respond", "no one is charged with
it", "there is nobody to send" is floor 1 on every town of the preimage and is the sitting's
own named failure mode; the hall, the market and the church are closed true everywhere; walls,
gates and a garrison are closed true at city and metropolis and OPEN at town, so neither a
perimeter nor soldiers may be asserted on a town-tier face and neither may be denied on any
[F1-25, F1-30]; a militia may not stand at town beside the required `Town watch`
(`exclusiveGroup: 'civilianDefense'`, "Present only when no professional watch exists")
[F1-26]; a court may be named as a word but no trial, gaoling, gallows or courthouse procedure
follows from a hall (`Dispute arbitration` p 0.8 at town, `Appeals court` p 0.8 at city are the
only recorded procedures, both civil) [F1-12, R-4]; and no prison row is required anywhere here
[F1-30]. On PLACE, the instrument's own rows bar four statements a writer will reach for
naturally: "inside the walls" and "outside the gates" for the burial ground are stated only at
city, "in the square" for civic announcements only at town, and "beyond the gate" for the
parish ground only at town — none may be asserted across the pool. On FLOOR 2, this subject is
a magnet for every barred form: no count of what is stored, of who is sick, of beds or of
months of grain, in a digit or in a word ("a few sacks", "most of the town", "a handful of
beds" are magnitudes) [F2-01]; no season, month, date, or "until the spring" [F2-02]; no rate
("every winter", "each harvest", "most nights") [F2-06]; no harvest that failed, no outbreak
that came, no granary that was built, no house that was given over [F2-04, F2-03]. The elapsed
licence, in exchange, is real and generous here: `hasGranary`, `hasHospital` and `hasChurch`
carry **zero pulse writers** and are the key's own reads, so the perfect and the durative ARE
lawful over them — "the stores have been kept here since before anybody thought to ask", "no
one sick has had to be turned away" — and the census marks as equally FROZEN `safetyLabel`,
`guardEffectivenessDesc`, `stress`, `config.monsterThreat`, `config.tradeRouteAccess`,
`foodSecurity.resilienceScore`, `foodSecurity.stockpile*`, `hasPort`, `hasNavy`,
`hasCourtSystem`, `hasPrison`, `economicGates.*`, `scores.military`, `scores.internal`,
`scores.monster`, `defenseProfile.institutions.*` and `standingDefenseForces`; **refused** over
`institutions` at every bucket grain (38 writers), `name` (201 writers), and — the one that
will catch a writer out — `defenseProfile.scores.disaster`, which `foodStockpile.js:473`
moves [ruling 11, §V.0 floor 2]. On FLOOR 3 the singular offices listed in (7) are barred;
nothing may be predicated of a deity, though the followers of a creed may act, keep a duty or
neglect it [F3-02]; and **F3-05 bites this pool harder than most** — eleven culture profiles
ship and no defense pool reads one, so thatch, the churchyard, the market green, hearth-smoke
and snow on the road are barred, and a pool whose furniture is grain, bread, a burial ground
and a market will reach for all five. On FLOOR 4: one purse runs the wall's keeping and the
soldiers' wages together and the four gates differ in degree and never in direction
(`defenseGenerator.js:177-192`, `:189`, `:223`, `:251`, `:614` — the disaster gate's floor is
0.55), so no split purse and no total collapse of pay [F4-02, F4-03, F4-04, F4-19]; no
permanence and no material decay clock over any fabric, since calamity, razing and the purse
remove it [F4-01]; `plagued` is MONSTERS and never disease, and this pool's subject makes the
word almost irresistible — disease is the separate `plague_onset` stress [F4-05]; the plague
may not be denied where the panel names it [F1-36, F1-63]; and the supply picture is not fixed,
because three different notes can sit beside the face on the granary line — "Granary + sea
access", "Granary in isolation. Endurance depends entirely on stored reserves", "Granary with
road supply. Cut the roads, cut the supply" (`defenseDisplay.js:245`) — so no face may settle
where the food comes from, and a blockade does close the sea supply absent teleport or airship
[F4-09 as re-cut, V-24]. Finally, section (2c) records that **no covert field marks this pool**:
the `compromised` tag is REFUSED here and every source draws honest; nothing on either page may
close a question the engine left open. No totality of safety [F1-34], no explaining the tension
away — a town this well arranged against two disasters is exactly the kind of thing
`contradictions.js` prints as a feature [F1-112] — and `{settlement}` in at most ONE unit of
the pool and never in a `[face]` sub-row [ruling 12].

(9) WHERE THE FLAVOUR IS

  WHAT IS IN USE. Two institutions the town built for a bad year, both of them working on an
  ordinary one, and both of them run by somebody who is not the hall. The granary is a door
  that opens on a decision: "State managed" is the city row's own word, and the grain behind it
  is the only thing in the dossier that is simultaneously the town's insurance and somebody's
  asset. The house that takes the sick is, on half the preimage, a religious community that
  also feeds travellers free or by donation and copies manuscripts for a living — the sick are
  one of several things it does, and the only one the dossier's key cares about. The market
  runs weekly, the toll comes off it at town and off the gate at city, and the bread's price is
  the number everyone in the town can quote without being asked.

  WHAT IS IN DISPUTE. Whose stores they are. The key says the grain exists; nothing says on
  whose word the door opens, and the menu is eloquent about it — rationing, grain loans and
  price stabilisation are all written into the granary's own service list and all of them sit
  BELOW the bar, which is to say the capacity is there and the town does not use it. That is
  a disagreement with two honest sides: the hall holding one purse against four calls on it,
  and the trades saying a store nobody is allowed to draw on is a store in name. Second:
  whether the care is medicine or charity, and who is owed it first — a house founded for the
  sick poor is not obviously a house for everyone, and a town that has never been tested has
  never had to decide. Third: the register. The sexton knows who died and of what; at town he
  writes it down, at city nobody does, and the difference between a town that counts and a town
  that does not is a difference the dossier can dramatise without asserting a number.

  WHAT THE ABSENCE LOOKS LIKE ON THE GROUND. There is no absence here — that is the hook, and
  it is a harder one to write than a lack. This pool's towns are well arranged and untested:
  the buffer is full, the door is shut, the watch is part-time at town and the hall has
  answered no difficult call about either. What a game master can pull on is the gap between a
  capacity and its use — the service that exists and is off, the institution that answers to
  the faith and not the town, the grain that is the town's insurance and a merchant's asset in
  the same breath. The dossier's job here is to make a reader feel that everything is in place
  and nobody has yet found out whether it works.
