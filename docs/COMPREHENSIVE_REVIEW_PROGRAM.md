# THE COMPREHENSIVE REVIEW + FIX PROGRAM (Playbook PART 9 grade-check, executed)
## Opened 2026-07-13 — Fable 5 main loop (surveyor/architect/manager/checker) + Opus 4.8 (verifier/implementer)

This is the live program doc for the owner-directed comprehensive review of the ENTIRE codebase
followed by a verified fix program. It is written so a successor AI (or a fresh session after a
usage-window reset) resumes from THIS FILE + fresh `git log`/`git status` + the playbook §0.0 state
ledger — never from a session digest.

> **Progress** (append after every phase/wave — this blockquote alone must reconstruct program state)
> - 2026-07-13: Program opened on branch `review-fixes-2026-07-08` @ 62c81a0c (M11b calamity tip,
>   clean tree). Phase S (survey) DISPATCHED: workflow `wf_c21bb055-cb9` — 28 Fable agents
>   (18 subsystem readers + 10 dimension reviewers), running in background. Baseline full gate
>   (`npm run check`) running concurrently on the clean tree; result to be recorded here.
>   Nothing committed by this program yet except this doc.

## The owner's directive (2026-07-13, verbatim intent)
1. Fable 5 does the survey + dimensions survey: read/review/analyze the ENTIRE codebase; deliver
   objective, holistic, comprehensive, exhaustive thoughts on it as CODE, as PRODUCT, and how well
   the code meets the product's goals and ambitions.
2. Only after that: for each finding, Opus 4.8 (ultracode) both VERIFIES the finding and IMPLEMENTS
   the fix — comprehensively, coherently, seamlessly, carefully, cohesively, exhaustively.
3. BOLD-OVER-SAFE, owner-escalated: "If you ever have to choose between maximal safety of the
   current architecture vs something objectively better that comes with risk or overhauling the
   architecture, choose the latter every time and clean up. I am trying to mature my code to
   absolute perfection — not simply fix it cleanly where it is at."
4. Substantive logic is in scope: cohesiveness, appropriate counterparts to mechanics, whether the
   sim makes sense — "as cohesive, complete, and immersive as possible, not just in code but in
   experience."
5. Fable 5 acts as architect, manager, and checker after each fix.
Constitutional laws (§0.2) and product boundaries still bind (the owner's bold-over-safe has always
been "within the constitution" — §0.2-6). Owner-gated classes are NEVER self-ruled: push/deploy,
migrations, schema/persistence shape changes, data deletion, security posture, paid-surface
behavior, budget raises, golden regens.

## Phase plan (checkboxes are the resume pointer)
- [ ] **Phase S — SURVEY** (Fable): 18 subsystem readers + 10 dimension reviewers, structured
      findings. Workflow `wf_c21bb055-cb9`; script + journal under the session dir (see Artifacts).
- [ ] **Phase A — ASSESSMENT** (Fable main loop): synthesize into
      `docs/COMPREHENSIVE_REVIEW_2026-07-13.md` (the deliverable: holistic assessment + the full
      findings register). COMMIT it — that makes the survey durable across sessions.
- [ ] **Phase V — VERIFY** (Opus, `model:'opus'` on every agent): adversarial verification of every
      actionable finding (refuters; majority vote on majors). Verdicts appended to the review doc.
- [ ] **Phase P — WAVE PLAN** (Fable architect): confirmed findings → fix waves (small, independently
      committable, highest-value first — so a window cut loses at most the in-flight wave). Wave
      table appended to the review doc with fences + gates.
- [ ] **Phase F — FIX WAVES** (Opus implement → Fable §0.3 manager check → exact-stage commit →
      ledger row in playbook §0.0 + Progress line here). One wave per commit. Full gate per wave
      (`npm run check`); constitutional spot-checks (goldens byte-identical, any-cast 2252,
      verify:dist at budget 1,255,985).
- [ ] **Phase E — END**: final full gate, playbook §0.0.3 refresh, memory update, final report.

## Resume protocol (for a successor session — START HERE)
1. `git status` + `git log --oneline -15` — trust the tree, not any digest. Foreign WIP is preserved,
   never touched.
2. Read playbook §0.0 (state ledger) + this doc's Progress blockquote + phase checkboxes.
3. If `docs/COMPREHENSIVE_REVIEW_2026-07-13.md` EXISTS and is committed: the survey is banked —
   resume at the first unchecked phase using its findings register (each finding has id/severity/
   file/evidence/verdict columns; unfixed = no wave row yet).
4. If it does NOT exist: the survey died in flight. Check the workflow journal (Artifacts below) for
   partial agent reports — salvage what parsed, re-dispatch only the missing slices (the slice list
   is in the workflow script, same path). Do not re-run completed slices blind.
5. Baseline gate truth: the pre-program `npm run check` result is recorded in the Progress
   blockquote once known. Any red found there is PRE-EXISTING (verify against base before blaming a
   wave). Known env flake: `pipeline.property` seed-sensitivity can time out at 20s under machine
   load (documented in round-21 plan, confirmed on untouched base).
6. Model split (owner standing): Fable = survey/architecture/management/checking; Opus 4.8
   (`model:'opus'`) = EVERY verifier + implementer agent. If the session model is Opus, run Phase
   V/P/F mechanically per this doc + playbook §0.3; queue re-grades for Fable.
7. Deferral ledgers (do NOT re-find as bugs): playbook §0.0.2 + §0.6 + §0.8; round-21 plan
   (Progress/Deferred/owner-decision queue); the review doc's own deferral section once written.
